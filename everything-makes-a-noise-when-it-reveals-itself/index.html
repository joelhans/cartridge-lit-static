    <h2>a chapbook by Lisa Ciccarello</h2>
  </article><article><p>
      Everyone keeps trying to give me this daughter. She has been in<br>
      my house, but she did not come with me. I am following her<br>
      around the top of a town I think is the whole town. Even the<br>
      river is just a surface. A street down which I look both ways.<br>
      The solid ground, the stone floor of the church, each drawn on<br>
      rock is a hint she leaves. The basement is a darkness you donâ&#128;&#153;t<br>
      even know is there. I touch my forehead with two fingers.<br>
      Everything I can feel right now is mine.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      The town is burnt & they live in the ash-blacked walls like<br>
      nurses. They pace back & forth by the bed, weeping. Each one<br>
      holds the knife she entered with. Each one trails the bandage,<br>
      wedded to the building & the secret fire beneath. The hospital<br>
      is all flesh & the barbed wire of knowing what youâ&#128;&#153;ve done. The<br>
      nurses sob without a sound, blood that spills out like breath.<br>
      Nothing is burning now.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      In my walking dreams I dreamed this town & you promised it<br>
      to me. I dreamed this lake & these pines & these buildings too,<br>
      though the sun touched them when I dreamed. When I woke up<br>
      from walking I was alone in the town, but the town had rusted<br>
      under the endless ash-fall of night. I took your wallet. It was the<br>
      smallest thing I could be sure youâ&#128;&#153;d come after. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what<br>
      youâ&#128;&#153;re going to face the dead for. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not rust that covers the<br>
      town, itâ&#128;&#153;s blood. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not blood, itâ&#128;&#153;s the sound of the town<br>
      burning every time it snows.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      At the gates I wish I could make you go back. You simply push<br>
      the gate aside. That scraping sound is everywhere. The town<br>
      is setting itself up behind you. It creates the past as you walk<br>
      down this hall. It looked like a hall but now itâ&#128;&#153;s an office.<br>
      It looked like an office but itâ&#128;&#153;s another jail.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      A hole appears. The hole is another kind of trap. He tries his<br>
      hand at the knife, the light, the rescue. All the women wail. You<br>
      are following a shadow that bleeds. At the end of the road is a<br>
      tunnel. At the end of the tunnel is a room. You canâ&#128;&#153;t leave the<br>
      room. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the way these holes work.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      We want to know what the dream is. You dream that the room<br>
      is a film & light burns the room back into what it was before.<br>
      Someone calls you on the phone & tells you to save them.<br>
      They have a token, they say, if you need it.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      The flashlight is an umbrella & a beacon: it splints the weak<br>
      wrist but the darkness nurses in your direction. You want to<br>
      ask everyone you see what is going on but everyone you see is<br>
      screaming. No one can read the sign on the ground, no one can<br>
      help me get out of this building, no one can tell me the name of<br>
      the girls hanging in perfectly arranged rows.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      When you said anything you didnâ&#128;&#153;t mean these: bound at the<br>
      waist & backs split open. They stand up & stand up. Stay on the<br>
      road, they say. This is the road, they say: come to me. The map<br>
      is real, like something Iâ&#128;&#153;ve only just learned how to pronounce.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      You turn in time with the memorized map till you reach a wall<br>
      made entirely of nurses: gouged out faces beneath the bandage.<br>
      They are alive in the light & want to put an end to it.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      There are hooks in the flesh of the floor. Up & down on the<br>
      chain like carousel horses. The pretty paint, the skirted legs.<br>
      You point the flashlight forward but turn back. The legs are<br>
      twitching. Or shivering. The nurses are the dark. They crowd<br>
      out the light with their blindness. They are shivering their<br>
      skin off so it will not have to know what follows.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      Itâ&#128;&#153;s a ghost that runs away, itâ&#128;&#153;s a ghost and not those pink little<br>
      girls with their backs all sewed up, itâ&#128;&#153;s a ghost that plays the<br>
      childâ&#128;&#153;s toy. Listen. There has to be a clue in the song. There is<br>
      always a song that solves something. The keys are animals:<br>
      bears for the bear thatâ&#128;&#153;s chained to the ceiling, birds for the<br>
      bird & the shovel, dogs for the incessant barking of the snow.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      They show me a picture of a girl who is not my daughter.<br>
      Everyone is furious. She cannot belong to me because too much<br>
      time has passed. In which none of them has changed. There is<br>
      something we all donâ&#128;&#153;t understand about my daughter.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      You watch her mouth move but the name of the town is silent &<br>
      everything in the town is named after the town. The painting<br>
      where it burns doesnâ&#128;&#153;t say a thing. You watch her mouth move<br>
      but the water covers it up.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      In the water the blood is a dye & when you want to see<br>
      the message you use the water like a bleach to eat away at<br>
      everything that is not the message.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      They are going grey and slack in there & no one pushes food<br>
      into the grates, no one pushes water into the grates & the water<br>
      comes down from the ceiling & it washes their bodies right<br>
      through the hole & they are too dead to notice the other<br>
      children coming down the hole.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      The pool is drained but the baby carriage is still in the center.<br>
      The children are slow to starve. Their ribs make a dry pool<br>
      beneath their caved-in mouths. There is a treasure made of<br>
      metal in the carriage. Run. They bend back. They are trying to<br>
      spread their ribs like wings. They are taking a very deep<br>
      breath. They are trying to blind you with what comes next.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      The ladder is a symbol for the fire to run up: there is counting<br>
      for anticipation. How much worse the heat than the fire, how<br>
      you plan to breathe your lungs away before your skin. Itâ&#128;&#153;s just a<br>
      guess. Never the rope, where it burns & slips; instead the metal<br>
      clamp, the palm that never recovers. & who is left to see it: sack<br>
      on a stepladder.
    </p>
  </article><article><p>
      She saunters along behind you. Just a dream, she says. You<br>
      think sheâ&#128;&#153;s dreamed herself the wrong shoes. She thinks sheâ&#128;&#153;s<br>
      dreamed her voice into a new animal. & a terrible one. Might as<br>
      well have some fun. She is going to try to seduce you when all<br>
      she has left is hair, long hair that covers the ghost of her body &<br>
      you are going to pin her to the ground with obedience, yes.<br></p>
  </article><article><p>
      You watch what is left of a woman come through the thin skin <br>
      of the wall. She shakes & crawls. Both of you count the tiles that <br>
      separate you, but come to different conclusions. Itâ&#128;&#153;s hard to <br>
      know what you are so afraid of. All she wants is to get up into <br>
      the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatâ&#128;&#153;s you. & you are really trying.
