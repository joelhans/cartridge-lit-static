<p>It might have been easier in the past<br>to deliberate. The day gives to night and in a pasture<br>stars are still candent. In a town a general store<br>is still general, its shelves warp<br>under dichotomies. Do we buy the food<br>or take the ammo? Saloon doors are never quite shut.<br>A family in a wagon is called a party. On the trail<br>thereâ&#128;&#153;s an amber spot in the canvas<br>the little ones stare at. The same sun hits the oxen,<br>the Kansas River. Do we ford the river or caulk the wagon?<br>In the water there is more than water.<br>In the oxen more than skulls.</p>

<p><strong>Jockey Box Talks</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes Paâ&#128;&#153;d be up on the jockey box and heâ&#128;&#153;d have his whip folded like serpentine in his lap likeÂ you know a snake and he’d be lookin back at us his boys and me and John weâ&#128;&#153;d know from theÂ serpentine folding that weâ&#128;&#153;s about to hear some talkin you know the way pa’s talk when timeâ&#128;&#153;s gottaÂ get passed and most times Johnâ&#128;&#153;d stop indian-burnin me jus enough to draw up the canvas and Pa IÂ suppose would reckon the dust was jus happenin to get in, but sometimes like this time Iâ&#128;&#153;m tellinÂ you about we figure we oughta give him his and like heâ&#128;&#153;s always sayin Pay Mind and that, so this isÂ one evenin when Paâ&#128;&#153;s whip is folded up and his prairie grass is hangin real parabolic from his mouthÂ the sunâ&#128;&#153;s hittin it all beautiful like the sun if youâ&#128;&#153;s can picture it itâ&#128;&#153;s comin through the tasseled headÂ of it, the grass, like itâ&#128;&#153;s still in the ground where he picked it and when Pa starts talkin it stays on hisÂ lip bouncin when he talks which I donâ&#128;&#153;t know about John but I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t stop lookin when Pa startsÂ in about Remember Ma didnâ&#128;&#153;t die of dysentery for nothin which I thought was like a hell of a way toÂ start in but Pa probablyâ&#128;&#153;s done the math heâ&#128;&#153;s got our ear for jus so long before weâ&#128;&#153;re indian-burninÂ or you know drawin up the canvas, so he goes Ma didnâ&#128;&#153;t die of dysentery for nothin boys we gottaÂ pay mind to that we gotta pay mind that dyin is like dyin is like remember the snow weâ&#128;&#153;s had inÂ Casper when Johnâ&#128;&#153;d said, â&#128;&#152;Pa is this gonna be the new landscape?â&#128;&#153; As in, â&#128;&#152;Is this what itâ&#128;&#153;s gonna be?â&#128;&#153;Â And heâ&#128;&#153;d meant like can the world change like that, as in underneath you? As in jus in a night?Â Alright and so the thing with Ma is like that. Remember John? What I said after the snow? About itâ&#128;&#153;sÂ like the trees the way they get quiet when they donâ&#128;&#153;t got their leaves? Even when the windâ&#128;&#153;s blowinÂ good? And then me and John we didnâ&#128;&#153;t say nothin but only cause we was thinkin, jus you knowÂ thinkin about what Pa said, and part of what I was thinkin Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you was the sun wasnâ&#128;&#153;t long hittinÂ Paâ&#128;&#153;s grass the way it was.</p>
