      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2018-09-26T22:40:10-05:00">September 26, 2018</time><p><strong>Duke Nukemâ&#128;&#153;s Peacekeeper .45 Talks Back, in Non-Heroic Couplets</strong></p>
<p>Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no easy way<br>
to peacekeep, to hold back</p>
<p>the imagined terror<br>
of intergalactic creatures:</p>
<p>their foreign<br>
tentacles and</p>
<p>blue-skinned fists.<br>
Simply, I donâ&#128;&#153;t have that</p>
<p>authority. Simply, I am<br>
triggered</p>
<p>by a white-man fingers<br>
until my muzzleâ&#128;&#153;s dark</p>
<p>barking has quieted<br>
every targetâ&#128;&#153;s breath. </p>
<p>Damn. Why am I forced<br>
to speak this </p>
<p>simple barbarian? Why<br>
does only my tongue</p>
<p>burn with the gun-<br>
powdered spelling</p>
<p>of cemeteries? How did I<br>
become a singular</p>
<p>definition of hurtâ&#128;&#148;<br>
as if my design</p>
<p>wasnâ&#128;&#153;t for someone elseâ&#128;&#153;s<br>
profit? As if Iâ&#128;&#153;d asked</p>
<p>to be made into this cold<br>
shape of murder? Truth be </p>
<p>told, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never known<br>
how to keep any</p>
<p>amount of peace<br>
within my loaded</p>
<p>frame. Truth be told,<br>
itâ&#128;&#153;s not these bullets</p>
<p>I unleash at targets;<br>
itâ&#128;&#153;s the rage</p>
<p>of never being given<br>
control.</p>
<hr><p><strong>As an Adult, I Learn About <em>Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City</em> </strong></p>
<p>and after watching a 60-minute YouTube video of someone playing it Iâ&#128;&#153;m asking<br><em>what in the holyfuck is this</em> / Remember: Jordan didnâ&#128;&#153;t allow himself to be used<br>
in video games / Remember: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve never played as him in my life / Remember: no child<br>
from my generation knows what itâ&#128;&#153;s like to control the best basketball player on simulated<br>
courts / Recall: <em>NBA Jam NBA Hangtime NBA Live NBA2K NBA Courtside</em>, many more games<br>
he denied / Because MJ bought and owned the rights to his own character / Because this legally prevented any digital resemblances of himself / So the closest thing Iâ&#128;&#153;d ever come to playing as <em>His Airness</em> was in bootleg games / I canâ&#128;&#153;t even remember / They featured white players on the Chicago Bulls with no names / A #23 with generic attributes / And Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure companies were sued for this / But imagine the shit-storm I felt when I first learned about this Jordan-approved Gatorade-endorsed video game from the 90s / And know that Iâ&#128;&#153;m a grown man as I write this / And know that in this game you can play as Jordan himself running around a haunted warehouse as he throws basketballs at robots with pink mohawks / And know that he high-jumps over booby traps / And he can even slam dunk on randomly placed hoops scattered across floating platforms throughout / Itâ&#128;&#153;s like a twisted <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> but with Jordan and pools of green acid you have to sky over / And the whole time heâ&#128;&#153;s dribbling a ball and there are other NBA players who are somehow trapped behind automated doors / And itâ&#128;&#153;s your job to save them / And to do this you select purple basketballs from your arsenal and throw them at different targets / And the purple basketballs explode into more purple basketballs / And when each level ends there is a bootleg <em>Jump Man</em> logo that emerges from center screen and grows bigger / And Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure if Iâ&#128;&#153;m better off having never played this or if FOMO can settle in decades after something real has happened / Hereâ&#128;&#153;s my truth: the internet fucks me up / It lets me know everything Iâ&#128;&#153;ve missed and always wanted / Like a severe post-disorder / It gives me conclusions I donâ&#128;&#153;t need: / 1) I really want to play trash games / 2) Jordan was and still is a Hall of Fame Douchebag who deserves to be dropped inside an actual haunted house full of acid pools and zombies / 3) I didnâ&#128;&#153;t watch the full YouTube video but some online trolls did and left entertaining comments / 4) Search this game along with <em>Shaq Fu</em>, <em>Bill Lambeerâ&#128;&#153;s Combat Basketball</em>, and <em>Barkleyâ&#128;&#153;s Shut Up and Jam Gaiden</em> / 5) Everything is becoming something else these days but I donâ&#128;&#153;t know why<br>
or how or when I will unbloom and leave this all behind.</p>
