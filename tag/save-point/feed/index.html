								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month, I was going to write about <em>Albert Odyssey, </em>a 1997 RPG for the Sega Saturn. It was the first game I requested—the first game I asked for after seeing an ad in a magazine for it when I was in sixth grade, and the first RPG my dad and I played together. It was the initial adventure that set us on course to navigate lots of dungeons together, share strange worlds, and absorb lots of narratives and memories along the way. This is my last <em>Save Point, </em>so I wanted to reflect on my first RPG as a kind of bookend, an honoring of endings and beginnings.</p>
<p>I’m thinking instead about <em>Final Fantasy X, </em>which does this in a different way. The first thing I wrote for <em>Cartridge Lit </em>was an essay on<em> FFX</em>. It’s in my top three favorite games, so I always feel like I have more to say about it. I’ve considered it plenty through a personal lens. This month, I’m contemplating it on a larger scale.</p>
<p>I’m wondering to what extent games can prepare us for crises—for crossroads with stakes that stretch beyond ourselves. I remember learning in middle school that Ulysses S. Grant wanted to be a math teacher before the Civil War started, and being really surprised by that, being really startled by it. I think this is because it made me realize that we all have multiple potential paths within us, and which one unfolds isn’t just up to us. We’re swayed and shaped and sometimes pushed by politics and global affairs and sometimes armed conflict. That sometimes our path is chosen for us. Later in life, I talked to a woman on a plane who said she wanted to write fantasy novels, but that she was studying political science instead because she thought she could do more tangible good that way. She said she couldn’t turn away from the problems of the world, and that she wanted to make a direct impact. Similarly, I met another woman who said she wanted to be a yoga teacher, but that she was studying environmental law instead. Obviously, there are lots of different ways to make a positive impact on the world. There are lots of ways to do good, big and small. Cultural and legislative. Publicly recognized and private and unsung. I don’t want to draw a false dichotomy here. What’s interesting to me is this moment when people see something they can’t tolerate and that overrides certain other paths. This moment when they feel called to something.</p>
<p>We see this in games all the time, and the games often make it look easy. Thoughtless, really. Those involved are just involved—there’s no deliberation. In <em>Final Fantasy X, </em>we don’t get to see Yuna, one of the main characters, make her decision to become a Summoner—in other words, to take up the power necessary to fight against an oncoming evil named Sin. When we meet her, she has already become a Summoner. Her father was a Summoner before her, and we don’t get to know if she grappled with the decision to follow in his footsteps or whether she always assumed this is what she would do. Yuna isn’t the narrator of this story, so though we see her struggle with the burdens that come along with the path she has chosen, we never know exactly how she arrived at it or what sparked her conviction. It’s a sad path at times, and a hard path. But she knows she can’t turn away from people’s homes being destroyed, from lives being senselessly lost.</p>
<p>I’m interested in this idea of what we would do if the world were a utopia versus what we choose to do in the flawed world we have. Games sometimes touch on this. After the big conflict is over, after the final battle is won, in the end credits, sometimes we see some kind of montage revealing what the cast of heroes does in utopian peacetime. Sometimes they get married, have children, become teachers, run businesses, travel, create inventions, make art, go back to school, or retreat from society in cabins in the woods. It’s framed as, “Now that the conflict is over, they can be their utopian selves.” But the world we have doesn’t work like this. There is never an end to the conflict. There is never a shortage of things we might do to try to make things a little less awful for somebody somewhere, even just one person. So sometimes, that reality numbs people. Makes them throw their hands up. And sometimes it makes them commit to a path where they can engage with what they see wrong. Again, these things aren’t easy dichotomies. Lots of people do both. Our stats aren’t set.</p>
<p>Because <em>FFX </em>is among my favorite games—because it’s been with me since such a formative age—I find myself looking at the world we have and asking, self-consciously, but also sincerely, “What would Yuna do?” Because our world isn’t tidy. It’s not so simple as, “Go into the cloister and prove yourself and then defeat the thing that everyone agrees is a problem. Use force and win and that’s it.” A group of plucky misfits can do a lot, but they can’t single-handedly save the world in a way that invites immediate utopia for everyone everywhere. And so many games wrap up on this plot point, and maybe that’s part of what makes them so appealing, but also what prospectively limits them. Given the flawed and complicated and red-tape-filled and often corrupt and bitterly divided world we have, what would Yuna do? How would she apply her good intentions? What path would she choose, were she not all-powerful? Were she just a regular citizen, one of billions?</p>
<p>I don’t say this to condemn games. Or epic narratives. Or hero stories. I think they help us dream and articulate our ideals. Dr. Rudine Simms Bishop famously states that stories—particularly books, but all kinds of stories—can be both windows and mirrors. They show us ourselves and show us each other. They show a version of the world. What we do next with that information is not prescribed; it is left up to us. Stories help open up questions.</p>
<p>Games aren’t always stories, but my favorites are. The ones I’ve written about here, in this column, for the past year and a half, mostly are. Maybe part of what I like so much about these games is, in fact, that they force me to face these questions. To ask, “What would your heroes make of our world, and what does that mean for how you should act?” A mirror and a window.</p>
<p>I started out in political science my first year of college and ended up in literature and creative writing. A direct inversion of the woman I spoke to on the plane. I hope that this is (and was) the right thing to do. That this is a meaningful path. I do believe writing has incredible power—the power to help spread ideas. Ideas are what motivate and justify actions, or help call them into question. The world we have is built on ideas. They shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Yuna would do if she were here, and I hope that even if in just some tiny way, I can help make the world better, through teaching, through writing, through small interactions in the day-to-day. I do think these stories we love so much prompt us not to be complacent—to keep asking what we would do if we could make a difference. Because in the end, we can.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have this idea that everyone wants to make art. I take a lot of Lyft rides, and when I tell drivers I teach creative writing in addition to composition and literature—I’m often requesting transportation to and from campus, and in those cases, my job comes up in conversation right away—they almost invariably share what artistic practices they pursued when they were younger and wish they had more chances to pursue now. Sometimes they tell me they still make art of some kind. Music. Dance. Writing. Painting. But normally, it’s a story of how they played a certain instrument or excelled in a certain class when they were kids, but now the machinery of adult life keeps them bogged down with obligations, that there’s no energy left at the end of the day. These practices are so easily lost in the cracks. People tell me this with wistfulness and bitterness, with yearning and nostalgia. It’s a lot of people—the majority. It’s something I’ve observed over years.</p>
<p>I was privileged to grow up in a family where art was valued dearly. My parents met in theater and ran a puppet show company when I was small. In between working full-time jobs, they stitched felt costumes, scribbled out stories, and memorized songs. Even when money was tight for him, my grandfather took me to museums and asked me my thoughts on sculptures and paintings. My afternoons with him were filled with VHS musicals borrowed from the library, during which he’d well up unselfconsciously and murmur, “Listen. Isn’t that beautiful?” While cooking dinner, he’d sing showtunes. He’d pretend to play trombones and trumpets.</p>
<p>On the national level, it’s another story. Art is much less of a priority, at least financially. Making up just a fraction of a percent of the national budget, the NEA is inundated with grant applications from individuals and organizations every year. Hundreds of hopefuls seeking support for their next big program or project. The same is true of state commissions and private foundations dedicated to the arts. I know—I’ve written a lot of these proposals. Some I’ve written in pursuit of my own creative goals. But the bulk were on behalf of a nonprofit I worked for a few years ago. To make the strongest possible case in each application, I poured hours of research into the benefits of arts education (interestingly, there is little research on the arts’ positive impact on adult lives). My findings confirmed what I’d long suspected: that inclusion of the arts in K-12 curricula increases school attendance and enjoyment, that it correlates with higher grades, that it is linked with long-term civic engagement…the list goes on. Firsthand, I’ve seen the arts benefit children, adolescents, and yes, adults in powerful, far-reaching ways. So qualitatively and quantitatively, art enriches our lives. And most people I know and most strangers I meet harbor creative ambitions. So why is this impulse, individually and collectively, so frequently shoved to the side?</p>
<p>Well, art can be expensive. It can require supplies and submission fees and entry fees and space rental and travel and promotion and more. Early on, it can require exposure and nurturance or curiosity and fierce determination—I’m continually amazed by my friends who grew up being told art was a waste of money and effort and still relentlessly pursue it anyway. Certainly, depending on a person’s goals, it can require navigating gatekeeping people, settings, and expectations ranging from exhausting to downright toxic. These are all true. These are all important factors. But the one I want to focus on here is time.</p>
<p>A 2015 study from the NEA found that time was the #1 factor limiting adults’ attendance of arts-centered events. More than cost, more than local access. It was time. Granted, this is for attendance. But I suspect the same might be true of creation as well. You look at these charts of famous artists’ daily schedules and you notice that not a lot of them had 9-to-5s. Recently I was asked to be on a panel of judges for a grant application, and time came up over and over again. People asked for supplies. They asked for fee coverage. But more than anything, they asked for breathing room that would allow them to create. Time off from work. A month’s living expenses. These are common asks, and for good reason. Art takes time to dream up and create.</p>
<p>This is true for me too. I teach five classes a semester, and during the school year, I feel very much in “teacher mode.” I’ve grown away from the idea that artists only create when inspiration strikes—I think of creativity more like a muscle now. Something you can strengthen over time, yes, but regardless, a part of you that isn’t going anywhere. Nevertheless, while I like teaching a lot, I find it hard to switch into “writer mode” while doing a good job on grading, lesson planning, and committee work. It feels like turning an enormous ship. Like that artistic mindset takes breathing room to settle into, and that work is a quick jog, requiring fast thinking, adaptability, and self-discipline. The poems, especially, I’ve tried to write during the school year don’t feel as successful as those I write during summer, when I can slow my pace a little.</p>
<p>So how does all of this relate to a video game? Earlier this year I played <em>Earthlock, </em>a crowdfunded RPG from the Norwegian company Snowcastle. Like some <em>Final Fantasy </em>games, your characters can switch roles (sometimes called “jobs”) and gain different abilities based on these roles. Importantly, they also lose certain abilities based on which role they’re in. Unlike <em>FFV </em>and <em>FFX-2</em>, though, where all playable characters can move freely between roles as they are acquired through play—any character can become a Red Mage, for instance, or any character can become a Knight as long as you’ve gained access to those jobs—in <em>Earthlock, </em>each character comes with two roles uniquely assigned to them, and these never change. So Amon can be a Scout or a Blaster; he can never be a Warrior or a Veteran like Olia, who can never be a Focus or a Pestle like Gnart, and so on. Each role is useful and even essential given the strategy needed for each battle. This presents an interesting challenge, and I liked <em>Earthlock </em>overall. But it frustrated me that I couldn’t have access to all my characters’ cool skills at the same time, and what irked me even more was that changing between roles, or Stances, takes an entire turn. The transition was painfully slow.</p>
<p>This felt relatable. This idea that we can all do certain things—unique things—but that switching between those modes or roles can be a gradual process. A process that requires our patience, that we can’t necessarily speed up. That it’s true, that I’m not just imagining it when the structured mindset of lesson planning feels different from the intuitive, emotional one I occupy when I write poems, and that it’s difficult to whip back and forth between them within the same hour. Yet, right before we all went our separate ways for summer, I told some friends in my department, “I’ve been telling myself this story that I can either be a teacher or a writer but not both at the same time. I have to rewrite that somehow. I have to tell myself a new story.” I have to do this because I want writing and teaching to coexist more harmoniously. I have to do this because if both are muscles, I don’t want to let either lie dormant for months.</p>
<p>I don’t have easy answers for this. I think this is part of the sweeping dilemma, the reason so many strangers I meet want to make art but rarely do. The transitions from employee to family member to artist to whatever can take adjustment, can take time. And time is something we are all short on, for innumerable reasons. This isn’t always something we can just will ourselves out of; we live in a culture that encourages workaholism and sometimes demands it for survival. We live in a world where countless factors, some chosen and some not, come between us and boundless creation. There’s a reason creativity crowns the mountain of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. But no model is perfect, and I’ve heard arguments against that way of thinking about art. That we need to tell a new story together, that Artist is a role we can switch into like Chef when we’re making a meal. I don’t have to navel-gaze about doing this—I just make food because I have to. I don’t see it as a role change. And maybe, with practice, I can do this with art. Make it a natural extension of life, not something separate and demanding.</p>
<p>I don’t have easy answers. I know this is hard. I also know these practices light a lot of us up, and I hope we can find ways to claim them in whatever ways we can. Quickly, slowly, or otherwise.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I wanted to add some new art to my home. In looking over the many images I gathered as prospects, my husband observed, “Everything you Pinned is a magical woman.” He was right. There were women with swords and women with spears. Women with lances and women with shields. Women whose hands glowed with spells and women who wore crowns made of stars. It was an unintentional but admittedly sprawling gallery of magical women. Specifically, magical warrior women. I want to interrogate this.</p>
<p>Where did this fascination start? With myth, probably. Diana. The huntress, the moon goddess, with her bow and arrow and stag. My mother read myths to me as a kid. Probably, the grain of this obsession lies there. I was always drawn to this kind of imagery. This imagery and this archetype.</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1990s. The “girl power” era. There was Sailor Moon. There was Xena. Buffy. Captain Janeway. The Spice Girls. I felt semi-surrounded by representations of powerful/warrior/magical women. Even if some of those reflections sent mixed messages, they provided a kind of aspirational mirror. I guess we would call them role models. Characters who modeled certain roles. Of leaders, of fighters, of heroes.</p>
<p>On the gaming front, there was Seung Mina. I adored her from the first time my ten-year-old hands arranged themselves on the wobbly joystick and smooth, indented buttons of the <em>Soul Edge </em>(a.k.a. <em>Soul Blade</em>) arcade game. I loved Sophitia, too, with her broadsword and shield. Her laced boots that reminded me of Diana. But I was better with Seung Mina—her slashing range weapon—and I loved her long braid, her athleticism. Her movements that were somehow both graceful and ferocious. Her confidence—that smile when she won a match.</p>
<p>A 2016 report from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media and the J. Walter Thompson Company found that out of 4,300 women in nine countries—Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—90% said that female role models in forms of pop culture like TV and film were important. 90%.</p>
<p>My father and I would go to the arcade, and I would save <em>Soul Edge </em>for last. This is because I was determined to beat it. I knew from the Character Select screen there were only so many characters to fight your way through before something different had to happen. This line of thought helped me persuade my father to contribute a few more quarters to my cause (though, to be fair, he didn’t need much coaxing). I got better each weekend. I learned Seung Mina’s combos. Gauged the alacrity of different opponents, the exact height of Seung Mina’s jumps. The coordination necessary to bounce back from a fall. I learned to see openings and take them.</p>
<p>Finally, one day, I made it to Cervantes, the ghostly pirate, a non-playable character. Thus, the presumed final boss. For several weeks, he finished me off. Each time Dad and I left the arcade, I had to start back from the beginning. Had to fight my way back to the shifting, tilting port with its ominous, carved Jolly Roger. “This is it,” I would say to my father. “It has to be.” Cervantes was muscular. Hulking and aggressive. I had to learn to be fearless. To not be afraid of his glowing, chilling eyes or his twin swords that swirled around his head, manipulated through telekinesis. His scowl or his gloating when I fell. I had to learn to get back up.</p>
<p>In the study, 61% of the women surveyed said female role models in pop culture have been “influential in their lives.” 58% said they made them “more ambitious or assertive.” In the U.S., 1 in 9 even said these kinds of representatives helped them leave abusive relationships. In Brazil, it was 1 in 4. This means something. These are more than “feel good” statistics. These are real lives changed. By stories. By mythic women.</p>
<p>So this <em>matters, </em>somehow. It matters that in playing a young woman with a halberd, I learned something about courage. It matters that my tiny, ten-year-old hands took on a murderous pirate. It matters that when Seung Mina and I defeated Cervantes, and when he wasn’t the final boss, and when his body caught flame and turned into something else—a demon, a blazing skeleton, an evil energy named Soul Edge—I didn’t back down, even though I was grossed out and a little afraid of his fiery skull. That I glared back and charged right at him.</p>
<p>It matters in the sense that games are simulations—safe places to explore what you could or might do. To experience vicarious power. Even though <em>Soul Edge </em>was a fighting game, it was also arguably a role-playing game. Something more interactive, at least in one sense, than a role model merely watched onscreen. The gaming medium offers an attempt, if just a small one—a subjective audition for the role itself.</p>
<p>It matters, somehow, that these characters sunk in. Such that still, to this day, I surround myself with magical warrior women.</p>
<p>I mentioned mixed messages. And in returning to Seung Mina and sort of “close reading” her as research for writing this, I was surprised at how sexualized she is in official and fan art alike. Did I notice her bare thighs and exposed midriff when I played the game as a kid? I’m sure this wasn’t lost on me. I’m sure I noticed. But I was too enamored with her warrior status to let it dissuade me much. Her status as a young woman taking on enemies bigger and stronger than her. I latched onto that despite, perhaps, some subtle inkling in my ten-year-old brain that maybe I was not the intended audience, the player they had in mind. As an adult, it felt strange to scroll through Google images and see rendering after rendering of this childhood hero in suggestive poses and shrunken attire. A little unsettling, like maybe I am foolish. That some interpretations, while maybe not <em>wrong, </em>are pushing against a tide. I see empowering. You see sex. An object—just an image.</p>
<p>In literary studies, there’s one branch of thought called reader-response theory that says that texts and characters don’t have single, fixed meanings. That we decide the meaning, we assign the meaning. That meaning lies with us. In close reading Seung Mina, I think about her weapon and how in real life I panic killing bugs. Then grieve and feel guilty. How I’m fairly adverse to violence. When I was younger, surrounded by warrior women, I thought I wanted to learn martial arts. Thought I wanted to handle weapons. I took tae kwon do lessons. Took fencing lessons. Trying to be like these heroes in a literal, tangible way. In the end, though, my interests shifted, and I chose to study stories instead. The weapons, for me, became metaphors in a way that still left them appealing. A painting of a woman with a weapon signaled agency—it’s the image of the weapon I grew to like, not the actual weapon itself. Maybe someone else would interpret this archetype differently; that person might learn to swordfight. My younger self saw steel and wood; my older self, analogy. Is one of us wrong? Is there a right or wrong way to “read” a young woman with a spear?</p>
<p>Empowerment and role models are tricky things. Elusive and personal things. But 90% is not a small number, so there’s something vital in them. From Diana to Seung Mina to the artwork I Pinned, this archetype of the magical warrior woman is rattling around in me, resonating. Though it’s complex and messy, still we get to claim what the woman with the halberd means.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I am holding onto my pet for some sentimental reason. (For example, the pet belonged to a now deceased family member, the pet helped me through a hard time in my life, etc.) </em></p>
<p>This is one of the Yes or No questions, out of six pages of questions, on the checklist my husband and I methodically peruse, trying to decide whether it is time to dial up the veterinarian who will come into our home and put our terminally ill cat “to sleep.”</p>
<p>Later I read this question to my father over the phone and he balks. “Who would say no to that?” he asks. “Who could say no?” It’s a fair question.</p>
<p><em>The pet helped me through a hard time in my life, etc. </em></p>
<p>What do we really mean when we say, “et cetera”? The utterance lost at the end of the ellipses. What muscles in between hulking parentheses like a linebacker in a center airplane seat the moment our voice trails off. Sitting there and scowling. Wanting to be said.</p>
<p>This month I’m thinking about <em>Lunar, </em>an RPG made for the PlayStation in 1996. In it, you play Alex, a young man who sets out to rescue his friend after she is revealed to be a goddess and predictably, the evil forces of the world come and claim her, desiring her power. Along the way, you meet lots of new friends and face lots of new enemies. As with any RPG, sometimes you will “KO,” or get knocked out during battle when your HP reaches zero. In some games, this state is called “Unconscious.” In some, it’s simply called “Death.” <em>Lunar</em> calls it “Faint.” We can use different terms, but we mean the same thing—the enemy was too much and you failed to stay upright. “Failed to” or simply “couldn’t.” I guess there’s room for interpretation here. Even if the result is the same.</p>
<p>In every game I’ve played except <em>Lunar</em>, it’s on you to keep yourself and your party members upright. It’s on you to make sure you’re prepared to enter the dungeon, taking care that your armor has sufficient defense stats and your inventory of items is appropriately full. Depending on the stage of the game—and the amount of money you have—you can purchase herbs and tinctures and berries and potions that will restore a little, a medium amount, or a lot of HP, for use before you die/KO. Ideally, they will be all you need. But you can also purchase herbs and things that will revive you—bring you back from incapacitation. In this way, “KO” makes more sense than “Death” to me, in the terminology of games. You can’t bring people back from death. But rock bottom? A state of waking unconsciousness? Yeah. You can sometimes beckon people back from that.</p>
<p>In every other game, this is on you. You need to prepare. If you KO/die, it’s revive or game over. But in <em>Lunar</em>, Alex has a furry companion, Nall, who will sometimes bring him back. No one is sure what animal Nall is at the start of the game. He’s brown and black and white with feathery wings. People call him a cat, though he’s clearly not a cat. He’s not a playable character, but he has a lot of in-game dialogue. He’s a presence in your life. And in battle, every so often, when you KO and can’t or won’t revive yourself, he will swoop down beside your lifeless body, shake you a little, and say, <em>Come on! Get back on your feet! </em>Then, you’ll regain a little HP. You’ll come back from KO and get up.</p>
<p><em>The pet helped me through a hard time in my life, etc.</em></p>
<p>It’s 2012 and I live in a state where I don’t have friends yet. I’m coming out of a messy, painful breakup. Some months I struggle to pay my bills. My depression is so deep, some mornings, I don’t want to get out of bed. My limbs feel like they are full of pebbles. Like I am a pebble-filled woman. My phone alarm jingles and I stare at the ceiling and I stare at the ceiling and ask myself, <em>Why should I? </em>I hit snooze and roll over and stare at the wall. I do not revive myself.</p>
<p>But there’s a twitch at the door, and the creak of a board. The puff of black and white fur. The cat comes in and her eyes look at mine and she jumps on the bed and purrs. <em>Come on, </em>she purrs. <em>Get back on your feet. </em>It’s a sound I can’t resist. I sit up despite myself, a little restored. An HP or two is better than zero. It’s something better than zero.</p>
<p>This happened in lots of battles. This happened more than once. Sometimes you live for someone else during these rough patches, these stretching “et ceteras.” Someone who is all love and all need. You have to care for them and so you get up, leave the pebbles in bed for a while. You feed them and figure you might as well eat too. You shower. You care for them, and in doing so, you have to care for yourself.</p>
<p><em>If I were in a similar situation, I would not want to live. </em>Another survey question. I had to stop on this one. But it also helped me know.</p>
<p>Luna fell ill. Rapidly ill. Her decline was swift and shocking. I kept denying it at first, thinking, <em>Maybe we’ll get a few more weeks. </em>It wasn’t until I saw her stumble and wanted to scream, <em>Come on! Get back on your feet! </em>that I knew the answer to this question. <em>If I were in a similar situation—</em>pause. Ellipsis. Et cetera.</p>
<p>Near the end of the game you find out Nall is a dragon. In a flash, his hidden power is unlocked and he grows enormous, takes his true shape. He’s vibrant, shiny, the size of a school bus. You ride him through the skies.</p>
<p>Once, I dreamt that Luna grew enormous and I rode on her back to school. I clutched her dark fur and nestled into her warmth, her milky scent. It was such a joyful vision, I thought of it a lot. Luna, a titanic beast. So powerful nothing could touch her.</p>
<p>The night before the vet came to our home, I dreamt Luna had feathery wings. She was crouching in the closet, where she was in real life. But in the dream, she had these bright wings. Luna, the healer, the little dragon. Ready to take her next shape.</p>
<p>No one gets to tell us how to grieve. I won’t say I don’t think there are wrong ways to grieve, but I don’t think there are “right” ways either. We can scroll through our inventories all we want, but none of our items quite get at it. Lots of people think they know what transpires when we die. That something happens. Or it doesn’t. Some have a lot of conviction about this. I know what I think happens. But the truth of it is that no one knows for sure. So all we have, really, is hope.</p>
<p>I hope she took flight toward the sky, growing enormous as a school bus. I hope she shook off that cocoon of discomfort and licked her new fur clean. I named her Luna because I loved the moon and the way I saw it in the crescent on her belly, that archer’s bow of white. I hope she is up there drinking the moon, huge bowl of cream that it is. Chasing the stars like houseflies.</p>
<p>No one gets to know. But I hope this for us. That our “et ceteras” can span to infinity.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For better or worse, lots of us want to “have it all.” “It” may look different for each of us, but often, there are underlying themes. Caring relationships. Work we have a talent for and that we enjoy. Upward mobility. Security, fun, and comfort. Passion and a sense of purpose. The blueprints around which we build their lives are as many and varied as the brains that dream them up. But any time we want more than one thing, the question of how to have both the new and the old sneaks into play. The more things we want, the longer and wider our reach must become—long enough, wide enough to capture “it all.” The better jugglers we must become, too, since acquiring or establishing things is only half the battle. There’s the maintenance, too. The “having.”</p>
<p>I think this is part of what entices me so much about games, particularly RPGs. Assuming you fight enough, you’re guaranteed a steady income. You almost always have built-in best friends and romances, or at least mutual crushes. Your airship is a kind of home, a traveling hostel for your eccentric companions. In leveling up, you always progress. It is almost impossible to stop progressing. You’d have to play the game for a long time. You’re a hero, a leader, an expert in your field. In the midst of the drama of saving the world, you enjoy lots of pleasures parenthetically. You kind of have it all.</p>
<p>There’s one game I’ve played that takes this idea a little more literally. It’s called <em>Life Quest. </em>In this late-2000s PC game from Big Fish, you take on the role of a recent high school graduate who engages in contests with former peers to see who can achieve certain milestones first—things like getting a job, purchasing a vehicle, adopting a pet, and so on. The game frames these as “friendly rivalries.” It’s a tension presented as the gym buddy idea—if you hold me accountable and I hold you accountable, we’ll be more likely to meet our shared goals. But the contests can stress you out, too. This is part of games, part of why they work—they get under our skin. They make us compete. They make us want to win.</p>
<p>I played <em>Life Quest </em>during a gap year I took between undergrad and grad school. At that time, I was aimless. I’d applied for the Peace Corps and been rejected (thanks, weird dietary stuff). I’d prepared no backup plan. Eventually, I applied to grad school, which launched my career in higher ed. But in the interim, I treaded water, working a demoralizing retail job and wondering how all my friends made flourishing look so easy.</p>
<p>My then-boyfriend played lots of PC games, and I occasionally glanced over his shoulder. <em>Life Quest </em>wasn’t my usual style of game, but he encouraged me to create my own character, and I was quickly drawn in. It felt painfully relatable to my own situation, this series of “friendly rivalries.” In my waking life, I felt like everyone I knew was passing me by. In the game, at least I could eat at fancy restaurants and watch my avatar pull ahead on a literal racetrack that charts your advancement in contrast to the AI’s. Playing <em>Life Quest </em>was simultaneously masochistic and satisfying. It provided a simulated path out of my rut—a kind of vicarious hope. Just by clicking the “work” button repeatedly, I could accrue cash and increase my standing. Just by taking an acting class, I could boost my “charm” points and attract a compatible mate. Happiness, promotion, health, and esteem were all within my reach if I just managed my time and resources correctly. Life was just a puzzle to be solved. A game that was possible to win.</p>
<p>A while back I was up for a big opportunity I didn’t quite get. It was hard not to be disappointed. I had started dreaming about certain milestones I might check off an invisible bucket list I hadn’t known I possessed. <em>Spend a certain amount of money on home furnishings. Take your significant other out on a certain number of dates. </em>These are things the game encourages you to do. Requires you to do, in fact. <em>Life Quest</em>’s soundtrack echoed in my head as I pictured my avatar bursting through some eagerly beckoning, preprogrammed finish line. The compulsory spotlight beaming its conic ray on my smiling avatar. The shower of confetti and fanfare that signified victory raining down on her. Her/me, I should say.</p>
<p>The week I learned I hadn’t gotten the opportunity coincided with a trip out of town. Slipping into the bathtub of a hotel room distant from my daily life, I stared absently at the wallpaper and felt the rising steam from the water warm my skin. I contemplated this setback and what it meant for my wants in life. What it meant for “having it all” and my stretching reach that couldn’t quite hold it. And as <em>Lifetime </em>movie-ish as it may sound, this really happened: my eyes focused on the flower-speckled wallpaper and I realized the cursive letters scrawled like fading ink in its sepia backdrop were partial lines from a seventeenth-century poem by Robert Herrick, a poem that is all about relinquishing that desperate, hungry reach. “Gather ye rosebuds,” the wallpaper cautioned. Something about time. Something about death. The language and the steam interlaced.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,</em><br />
<em>Old Time is still a-flying;</em><br />
<em>And this same flower that smiles today</em><br />
<em>Tomorrow will be dying.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately for us, depending on your perspective, life doesn’t work like <em>Life Quest </em>might suggest. We aren’t locked into competing with our friends. We aren’t locked into one version of success. Our happiness doesn’t automatically rise with eating, nor does it immediately dwindle when we’re at work. It isn’t a gauge. It isn’t that simple. These days there’s a movement to “gamify” everything, and to some extent, I can get behind that. Life can be devastating. Life can be tedious. I see little harm in thinking in metaphors, in analogies, that lend some levity to one’s daily grind. But it seems important to remember that these things aren’t formulaic. And all games end the same way. All games end.</p>
<p>That time I played <em>Life Quest </em>in my wandering gap year, a glitch caused the screen to black out abruptly while I was dancing with my spouse in a club. No matter how many times I rebooted the game, that was it—I was dancing, then darkness descended. “I guess I died,” I laughed. “Right there in the club. I just die. That’s how my Life Quest ends.”</p>
<p>Reboot. Dance. Flicker. And darkness. That’s how my Life Quest ended.</p>
<p><em>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.</em> The finish line approaches swiftly enough. There is no need for us to chase it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven’t played a video game in close to two months, and it’s time to unpack why. Part of it is logistical. The holidays hit. I traveled a lot. I wasn’t home with the consoles. Part of it is oversaturation. In a rush to finish <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>before finals week of fall semester, I played too much several days in a row, crouching in a blanket with a claw-like grip on the controller like a caffeinated gargoyle. I kept pushing on when I wanted to stop, something that rarely happens with games. Usually, I have to stop before I’m ready. In December, the drive to be done—before the papers came, before the new year turned—completely overtook the immersion and pleasure. I let something that was supposed to recharge me become a chore. But part of it is also a strange, lingering guilt I can’t quite shake—an uneasiness.</p>
<p>I hadn’t played <em>FFVII </em>since middle school. And even then, as I’ve written about in this column before, my dad did most of the playing and I mainly watched. I remembered the plot fairly well but thought, in light of the forthcoming remake, it would be wise to play it again as an adult. I’m in the minority that didn’t love the game. Setting and tone are big for me, and both were too bleak for my taste. I didn’t dislike it then or now; I just don’t adore it either. Still, I enjoyed working my way through the bizarre mini-games (I’m looking at you, submarine battle), unlocking the hidden characters, and growing the multicolored Materia. Despite having a basic recollection of the plot, twists surprised me here and there. Cloud was more sympathetic than I’d remembered him, Cait Sith less so. Tifa was way cooler than I’d given her credit for since, at age 12, I saw her only as competition against Aeris, whom I liked better, in a love triangle. The blackouts and blips in Cloud’s narration of stories made more sense to me, too, as an adult. Fear and wishful thinking can do this to us, make us gloss certain events and even sometimes delude ourselves. At least, temporarily.</p>
<p>So what continues to haunt me? I made a run at the sidequests, but it’s not like I tried to take on Emerald Weapon, an optional boss with a million HP, or Ruby Weapon, who has even more. I didn’t punish myself <em>that </em>much at the end of fall semester, sinking hours into quests that even with investment are legendarily difficult. I went beyond the minimum, but just a bit, just enough to tackle the final dungeon with ease. I didn’t raise a gold chocobo, an ostrich-sized bird that can take you to uncharted territories; I didn’t even try. Therefore, I didn’t get Knights of the Round, the game’s best Summon Materia that’s cloistered away on an obscure island. But so what? These were things my dad did, things I saw as a kid and said, “Nope, that’s too much for me.” I just wanted to finish a game and have fun before the term ended. I just wanted to replay the plot.</p>
<p>Only that’s not entirely true. Like Cloud, I’m remixing memory here, avoiding an unpleasant question. I did make a run at completionism—sort of. I did want to tangle with Emerald—sort of. I wanted to get that Knights of the Round, but without the endless tedium of breeding large birds. The only other way to do it is to defeat Ruby. To do that, you have to first defeat Ultima.</p>
<p>Ultima Weapon is an enormous dragon-like creature that flies through the sky near the end of the game. If you bump into it (Him? Her? Why does wondering make this sadder to tell?) with your airship, it will fly away and not bug you. If you really want to, you can follow it. Eventually it will stop and fight you. You have to do this several times. You have to be persistent.</p>
<p>Again, for some reason, the game won’t let you fight Ruby until you fight and vanquish Ultima. So I chased it around the planet like a hunter, like a villain. These monsters appear in the game as a sort of planetary immune system. They emerge in the air and sea and earth as a way to tell humans to relent, to back off. To reconsider their destructive ways. They do cause some damage. But more or less, they don’t bug you if you don’t bug them. However, if you bug them, you get good rewards.</p>
<p>I hesitated before bumping into it when it stopped over what I knew, from reading cheat notes online, was its final destination. I hesitated but then I bumped it and we fought and it died. And when it died there was a short graphic of it twisting in pain, like a spider sprayed with Raid, and roaring terribly, and then there was a blackout. And when the scene faded back in, there was a smear, a charcoal afterimage like what a firework imprints when it skids across concrete in a back alley. And a grassy mountain that blocked your forward march to plunder spoils is leveled. And so you march on. And you feel like absolute shit.</p>
<p>This decision has haunted me for months. I remember being cranky for the rest of the game. Maybe this is why I wanted so urgently to finish. I was cranky in the leveled-mountain dungeon. Cranky as I picked up spoils. Cranky as I wound my way down the vast crater that leads your party to the Big Bad. I wasn’t having fun anymore because I had killed something unnecessarily, something that was acting as the planet’s bodyguard, something that hadn’t attacked me, and I’d done it just out of greed. And yes, it’s a game. And yes, it was months ago. But that coil and scream still make me cringe. Because the impulse is something I don’t like. That greed—that devouring, marching-on greed. Something that wants it all.</p>
<p>Around the time of the election, I saw a lot of bumper stickers that said something like, “Giant Meteor 2016: Just end it already.” I saw enough of them that I thought, <em>This is more than a joke. We’re afraid we’re a failed experiment. </em>There are days when part of me—part of a lot of people, I think—would welcome a deluge of giant monsters to help keep humans in check. Maybe not attack our towns, but scare us, remind us we are part of an ecosystem. That this isn’t our party to trash. But if such things existed, we would certainly attack them. I wonder which side would win.</p>
<p>In this case, though I beat Ultima, Ruby kicked my ass again and again. So I let it lie. I said to the fictional planet, “I’m sorry. I respect you. I’ll go on my way.” I ventured down the huge crater, slaying, of course, scores of beasts that at least attacked me first (A glossing of memory? Wishful thinking? Do we tell ourselves these stories to patch up our shame?). I ventured down with my shiny new Materia and weaponry gained from Ultima’s death. I didn’t enjoy it. But I didn’t boot up the file pre-Ultima-defeat either. I tell myself I still can, I still might. I can undo what I did and end the game with its wings still flashing in the sky.</p>
<p>The thing is, I might not. I probably won’t. But at least, with games, there is the option.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, heck. <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/11/07/save-point-nights-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I just wrote about <em>Nights into Dreams </em>two months ago</a>, but it’s late December as I sit down to write this, I’m home for the holidays, and all I want to think about is <em>Christmas Nights into Dreams, </em>the original game’s sampler pack from 1996. (Don’t worry. I promise I have some different thoughts on this one.)</p>
<p>Playing <em>Christmas Nights </em>is a family tradition, and it’s tradition that’s on my mind this week. More broadly, this time of year. Most years, I travel home to the Seattle area to spend time with friends and family during the winter holidays. This involves staying at my dad’s house for the majority of the trip, which means that at some point my dad will ask me, his adult daughter, “Do you want to play <em>Christmas Nights</em>?” Though I sometimes initially smile and shake my head, he unfailingly follows this up with, “It’s no trouble. I’ll set up the Sega Saturn for you,” and before I know it, there I am, holding the dusty controller in my hands, left thumb on the well-worn joystick.</p>
<p>Today my dad sits down next to me on the guest bed and watches me sail through the first level as Claris, one of the two playable characters. He watches Claris tumble through darkness to the level, Spring Valley, which has been decked out in snow and glass ornaments in alignment with the Christmas theme. He watches me steer her up the frosty hill and into the pavilion where Nights, the jester-like dream spirit, waits. The two characters merge, Claris taking on the physical form of Nights, and I take off, soaring through the snow-dazzled sky and loop-de-looping through enormous fir wreaths, drill-dashing monsters and wracking up points. Claris’s version of Spring Valley is identical in the original game but for the holiday decorations, so between the two editions, I have played this level probably, realistically, hundreds of times. I have been playing it for 21 years. Damn. If my relationship with this game were a person, it could drink.</p>
<p>I fly through Spring Valley automatically, reflexively. I know every dip and turn. My dad murmurs, “Muscle memory,” watching me swerve around projectiles I know will be spit from monster mouths, as they always are, as they always have been. Timed so precisely in this side-scrolling track that only contains so much. Muscle memory—I could do this with my eyes closed. It is as familiar as my dad’s house. Even more so—he’s lived in this place seven years. The game goes back farther than that. I have swooped through this circuit so many times.</p>
<p>What is it about tradition that appeals to me? Why do I find this so comforting? Why, when the boss can’t even touch me once, do I still draw enjoyment from this? 21 years—this friendship could drink. It could vote. It could have its own kid. Reliability? Predictability? The absence of surprises? Why is old tradition reassuring?</p>
<p>At the same time, it might not be fair to say the game goes unaltered year to year. In playing it just before sitting down to write this, I asked myself, “Why do you never play as Elliot? Why always Claris?” This is the first year I’ve critically examined this ritual, and stopping to think about it, I realized I hadn’t played as Elliot in ages. A fuzzy memory emerged of me as a child feeling frustrated because his version of Spring Valley was backwards or something, some betrayal of the contract of familiarity, routine. After swiftly finishing Claris’s four-part track with all “A” scores, I hesitantly switched to Elliot. To my surprise, his track wasn’t backwards—it was a completely different track, one not replicated in the normal edition of the game. I, the supposed master of this sampler, bumbled my way through with one A and three Bs. Then beat the same boss, which was, indeed, mirror-flipped, but otherwise identical to Claris’s. It wasn’t hard and it wasn’t frustrating. But it amused me since the whole reason I booted up the game was to reflect on the nature of tradition, of permanence, of the feelings that nestle in that.</p>
<p>Then there’s the “Open Your Presents” portion of the sampler, which also touches on the tension between reliability and divergence. In a memory game setup, the player clicks on different wrapped boxes bearing question marks that flip over to reveal different images. If you uncover two that match, you earn a prize (things like image galleries, music files, and so on). If not, they flip back over, and you must acquire new chances by replaying Spring Valley—either Claris’s or Elliot’s will do. As far as I know, the packages are ordered randomly, though of course the prizes themselves remain the same. The battery on our ancient Sega Saturn won’t let us save, so every time I play <em>Christmas Nights, </em>the matching game starts anew. I move the cursor, click, and hope. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. This adds a little drama to my visits. Furthermore, there are certain boxes that contain images of Reala, Nights’s mortal enemy. If you click on Reala, your accumulated matching chances are erased—a kind of sudden death. When that snidely smiling clown face popped up today, accompanied by sinister music, my stomach still fell in the way it did when I was an aggravated tween. This, I suppose, can be part of tradition, too—the way it uproots us, unsettles. The way we sign up to be unsettled, knowingly. Even this, sometimes, can be comforting in its endurance—its steadfastness as something that remains over time. Frustration as muscle memory.</p>
<p>Every year I loop back to Seattle like Claris/Nights looping on a track. There are places I achingly want to see, reunions that make my heart light up. I revel in the similarity, take comfort in what goes unchanged. There are times when I feel like an infant who needs reassurance of object permanence—that the people I love will still be themselves, that I, too, will still be myself in their eyes. (I catch the predictable speed-increasing gusts and reach for the programmed gold rings, the ones I could grasp with my eyes shut.) At the same time, I revel in the newness—the breaks from tradition of who-is-doing-what. If my relationship with <em>Christmas Nights </em>were a human—a friend I could gather in a coat-and-scarf embrace—I would still be learning new things about it, as I am with real loved ones. I sat down to write about tradition but realize the actual insight here is that even the things we think we know best can turn and change and surprise us. That familiar touchstones are still intact, but it is arrogant to think they don’t move, that they can’t roll or crack open. That this tradition, written in pixels and air, requires my attention, my engagement.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s December, a time to think about endings and beginnings. December, for me, isn’t just filled with thoughts about the holidays, but also reflections on the year that’s passing out of existence and questions about the new one that’s about to start.</p>
<p>I associate <em>Wild ARMs</em>—a fantasy RPG set in a mashup of medieval Europe and the Old West—strongly with both beginnings and endings, so it’s a fitting game to write about this month. Beginnings in part because it was the first game my dad and I played for the PlayStation, endings in part because it has our shared favorite game ending of all time. But there’s more than that, too.</p>
<p>Do you remember LiveJournal? If you’re of a certain age, you probably do. It was one of the social media platforms popular before terms like “social media” became widely circulated—a kind of haven for kids who often felt more comfortable expressing themselves through writing than spoken conversation, or at least who were interested in publishing their adolescent musings for a small audience of friends. I feel almost silly bringing it up because it so precisely typifies a certain era—one of those icons that appears in “You know you grew up in the early ‘00s if…” memes. It’s a largely dead (or at least severely shambling) platform these days, something like Myspace. It’s still there, sure. But it’s kind of a ghost town.</p>
<p>At one time, though, this was an important site/cite for a lot of us. All my friends were on there in junior high and high school. Even the early years of college. Slowly, accounts dwindled away, my own included. But it used to be the place people gathered to share stories, learn more about each other, and offer consolation or cheer. Some of us knew each other face-to-face, some only online. After a friend from school persuaded me to join, I skimmed through others’ journals to get a sense of the tone, the culture. One thing I immediately noticed was that it seemed customary for people to introduce themselves with a semi-lengthy post that gave a sense of who they were and what they hoped to accomplish in creating an online record of their thoughts. After the perfunctory “I made a journal!” entry, I set about this, and the frame of reference I used to do it was <em>Wild ARMs. </em>I was obsessed with the idea of the Dream Chaser, a term the game used to describe people who wandered the wilderness exploring, doing good, taking odd jobs, and basically “seeking their fortune,” to put it in fairy tale parlance. Naturally, all three playable protagonists claimed this label.</p>
<p>What I identified as speaking to me about the idea of the Dream Chaser at the time was the <em>verb</em>-ness of it. A Dream Chaser was someone in constant movement—someone who wanted to travel, yes, but more importantly, someone who was restless inside, who couldn’t be eternally content in one place literally or psychologically. Someone who wanted to have some kind of ineffable meaningful adventure, a journey with a sense of purpose. My greatest fear at the start of tenth grade, when I wrote that entry, was stagnation. I was completely, utterly, unabashedly obsessed with it. Or more, the avoidance of it.</p>
<p>And even as I aged, even as I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, I held this notion close to my chest—a save point, an emotional touchstone. For as long as I had an online journal, some image from <em>Wild ARMs </em>was there in the assortment of my six 100&#215;100-pixel profile images. When, at 21, I met an artist who interviewed people, asking them what their greatest desire was in life and then handing them one of several premade “licenses,” and I described my desire to him, and he smiled and nodded and handed me a small, magenta keychain with the words “DREAM CHASING LICENSE” on it, my heart skipped. This was deep in the gaming hiatus, but that’s a phrase you don’t forget: Dream Chaser. A Dream Chasing License. Too perfect! A decade later, I still have it.</p>
<p>I’ve wondered on and off if this is something everybody wants: the “thrill of the chase,” as the license elaborates. “This license entitles you,” it says, “to chase your dreams across the universe. Enjoy the thrill of the chase and the excitement of catching the things you want most in life.” I wish I knew what the other licenses were. This one so accurately touches on what I described then, at 21, as wanting. What I wanted at 15, what I still want now: that liveliness, basically. Passion. An ongoing process of dreaming and pursuing—the freedom to wander that cycle. I think everybody must want this on some level. But I know there were other licenses, too, other “most desired” things in life.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>Wild ARMs, </em>Princess Cecilia abdicates the throne and continues her adventure with her friends, Jack and Rudy. She explains to her shocked companions, “I will think hard and be honest with myself. […] I’ve decided to live true to the desires of my heart.” While so many fairy tales’ happy endings consist of protagonists ascending to positions of power and comfort—symbolized, so frequently, by royalty—this one ends with the three friends setting off on a new journey, vowing to use their powers for good and to fight against the evil that still prowls the land. As a kid, I was incredibly moved by this: the conclusion that narrowed but then expanded into a new introduction. I know other quest stories end this way. But it was my first time seeing that move, and it jostled something in my heart.</p>
<p>It’s corny to reference, but in 1998, one year after <em>Wild ARMs </em>came out in the U.S., everyone was singing “Closing Time,” which claims that “every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.” And it makes sense, right? It was 1998. Almost the end of a millennium. It’s probably silly to quote that line like it’s probably silly to miss an extinct site, like it’s probably silly to hold onto a pink slab of plastic that says it’s a “DREAM CHASING LICENSE.” But I think this is the point of this month’s column: that endings and beginnings are recursive, really. That we look back and forward at the same time.</p>
<p>I hope, whatever the desires of your heart, that you have a good new year. That you grant yourself license to chase whatever dream. That your endings also furnish new beginnings.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was teaching, and my usually vibrant late-morning class was inexplicably glum. Students drooped over the fronts of their desks, eyes downcast. My PowerPoint slides and carefully planned discussion questions were met with shrugs and glances out the window. Finally, I stopped. Something clearly wasn’t working. “What’s wrong today?” I asked. “Everyone seems so sleepy.” Sometimes acknowledging this helps—reminds them I am human, that I get tired too. Pausing to recognize our shared march through a semester with too much work and too little sleep can lift the unspoken frustration hovering around us like fog.</p>
<p>Their response was different this time, though. As with times when I’ve called out the elephant of fatigue in the room, dozens of heads nodded in unison. But this time, the affirmation followed one student’s comment of, “Half the country is on fire.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” another echoed. “The Columbia River Gorge is burning, and we’ve had, like, three hurricanes this month.”</p>
<p>“It feels like the end of the world.”</p>
<p>I’ve wondered what to do about this. This: the swirling chaos outside the classroom. My regular approach has been to set it aside as best I can, to try to give them a break from the churning news cycle while equipping them with skills to rejoin the fray. I do this out of anxiety as much as compassion. When I teach, to some extent, I perform, put on a persona. The persona isn’t untrue. But it isn’t vulnerable, either. To eschew descending eyelids, I prance and gesticulate and cry things like “Holy cats!” while putting my hands on the sides of my face like a grown-up Shirley Temple. I do this to disguise myself. I try to buoy us.</p>
<p>But sometimes this doesn’t work. The weight of things just past the closed door leans and oozes in. And I’ve read that it’s better to recognize them. To not try to grin them away. I recently read this: that it matters, to students, that you name the mass shooting, name the catastrophe, name the fill-in-the-blank. I hesitate because I fear my own reactions to these things, because I fear letting my despair show. Because sometimes I still feel like I need a mentor, but that in this setting, I am the mentor. I sometimes don’t know what I need to hear, much less what I should say.</p>
<p>But on this day I pause. I say, “Yes.” Shut the textbook and let the persona slip, just for a minute. “It’s hard,” I say. “It’s sad.” I wish I could tell them the Gorge will rebloom like scorched land at the end of a movie. I wish I could tell them the hurricanes will lessen, that we can reverse the damage we’ve done as a species if we just stick together.</p>
<p>There are days when it feels like the end of the world to me, too. So what do I say to these students?</p>
<p>Last spring, a family member sent me to a Tarot reader. How much stock I put in Tarot varies, but I went with an open mind. At least, I think, divinations can be Rorschach tests, revealing through the reactions they provoke as much as the predictions themselves. Unlike in past readings, where I’d had a specific question, in spring I came as a blank slate. “I’m willing to receive any wisdom,” I thought. But still, without realizing it, I unconsciously hoped for insight pertaining to my personal life—marriage, friendships, artistic endeavors. I rarely think of work when I read my horoscope, draw a card, or meditate. Work feels separate from spiritual inquiry. For this reason, the reading surprised me.</p>
<p>Card after card related to teaching, to the role of the counselor. “Your job right now,” the reader said, “is to not let the young ones despair.”</p>
<p>But how can I help the young ones not despair when I’m fighting to resist that quicksand myself? What can sit in place of despair on the days when hope feels futile?</p>
<p>For the past month I’ve been thinking about <em>Nights into Dreams, </em>a Sega Saturn game from 1996. At the start of <em>Nights, </em>two children experience nightmares that force them to relive their own brushes with despair. For a girl named Claris, this comes in the form of a botched audition for the solo part in an upcoming concert. Despite her hard work and devotion to music, she freezes up under the glaring stage lights and succumbs to her fear of the panel of judges, who tap pencils impatiently and scoff. For Eliot, it comes when an older boy bests him at basketball in front of his friends, then chucks the ball into his stomach and laughs. At the end of each nightmare, the antagonists morph from human judges and bullies into horned demons with red eyes. They chase the children through misty green corridors until, at last, there is a light at the end. The light turns out to be Nights.</p>
<p>Leading the rebellion against a villain named Wizeman who seeks to enter the human world through dreams, Nights is a sprite who can merge with humans to push back the tide of evil as long as they retain one important quality. While Wizeman’s minions can rob sleeping humans of many “Ideyas”—floating colored spheres representing qualities such as purity, wisdom, hope, and intelligence that could be used against him—the one thing they cannot touch is the red Ideya of courage. At the start of each playable sequence, we see Claris or Elliot literally fall from consciousness into sleep, where the level of their dream awaits. Though they start each descent with five Ideyas circling around them, Wizeman’s monsters rush forward and strip them of all but their courage just before they touch the ground. Still, with that one bright circle orbiting around them, the children are able to fuse with Nights and soar through the air, reclaiming the stolen Ideyas and overcoming bosses, including, eventually, Wizeman.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, Claris and Eliot return to the sites of their initial nightmares to face their fears. When their respective antagonists approach, they steel themselves, closing their fists over their hearts, which glow briefly with red. In each of their concluding sequences, they confront their challenges undaunted, with Claris being awarded the solo and Elliot impressing the older boys with a slam dunk. In both cases, courage is framed as the untouchable quality—the thing that remains when all else has been taken.</p>
<p>When I played <em>Nights </em>at age 10, this lesson felt vital: Courage, yes, the untouchable thing. I was persuaded to face some of my own fears, wearing this story like a talisman. Yet even then, I questioned whether courage was always the needed quality—the surest, most necessary quality. <em>Shouldn’t something come before courage? </em>I wondered. And still, I wonder this. When everything feels taken from me, I’m not sure that what’s left is courage. I don’t know the name for what remains.</p>
<p>Being English graduate students interested in children’s literature, my friend and I experienced synchronized mini-meltdowns in 2012 when we watched <em>Rise of the Guardians, </em>a film in which characters must identify their “center” in order to win the day. One character’s is wonder. Another’s is joy. The center represents the core of their power, the thing that most closely defines them. We weren’t sure what ours were. About this, I wonder too.</p>
<p>What is left when the chips are truly down? When half of the country is on fire? Is it wishful thinking to rely on the presence of a “something” that shines in our fists or our hearts? A “center” that circles around us? I say to my students, “I feel that way too, sometimes, like the world is ending, but we have to keep going as if it won’t. And we have to do our part to make sure it doesn’t.” Awareness of the fact that many people through many generations have believed the world is ending: is that a form of hope? Or a slightly offbeat sibling? Is fatalistic hope the same thing as courage?</p>
<p>I want to believe I can get better at this, that we can face fears, rewrite nightmares. That maybe a center isn’t innate, but something decisive and constructed. I want to have answers for the nervous window-glancers, for the young ones looking for their future. I want to think maybe it isn’t emotion that steps in and lifts the roofs shattered by despair—that maybe it’s action. After all, it isn’t the glow that rewrites things. It’s what comes next that counts.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to write, this month, about grinding: the slow, repetitive process of leveling up and earning money in games. I was going to focus in particular on <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>and <em>Legend of Legaia, </em>two games my dad and I played when I was young.</p>
<p>To get where I want to go, I need to dwell on these a little. So consider this a grind if you want.</p>
<p>My parents divorced when I was five. I split my time between their places, eventually spending weekdays at my mom’s and weekends at my dad’s from about grade 5 through high school. On those weekends, Dad and I would play video games—mostly RPGs. To be honest, a lot of the time, he played and I watched. I was a timid kid, afraid of making a wrong turn in a dungeon or, God forbid, killing the characters in battle. I still get a knot in my stomach when I remember the time Dad left the room for ten minutes, handing off the <em>Final Fantasy V </em>party to me, and I somehow let everyone die. Not even in a boss fight—I put on some HP-draining armor or something and like that, they all KO’d. My palms grew clammy, my heart raced, and I had to stammer, eyes on the rug, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I killed them.” Dad wasn’t mad. These kinds of things just freaked me out. So, better to let him drive.</p>
<p>When we were together, we’d advance the games, him flopped on a bright yellow beanbag chair and me curled on our clashing antique sofa, wrapped in a plaid blanket, our calico cat perched on my lap. We spent hours like this, eating pancakes, drinking Mountain Dew. Him guiding hero after hero through quest after quest, scrolling through dialogue, and me urging like a backseat driver, “Heal them! You never heal them!” “You can’t win if you don’t attack,” Dad would say. And usually, he’d be right. This was my anxious-kid introduction to video games. It all felt very high-stakes.</p>
<p>When we weren’t together—when Dad had the rental house to himself for the week—he’d grind. He didn’t want to advance the story without me. So he’d grind and grind to the envy of my gamer friends. I’d come over on a Saturday and the party would be ten, sometimes fifteen levels higher than when I’d left on Monday. In my absence, he’d run in circles on world maps and grind.</p>
<p>When I watched him in dungeons that actually progressed the storyline, and when, even there, the same programmed monsters popped over and over again, Dad had a saying for that too. Borrowed from Han Solo, muttered under his breath: “Didn’t we just leave this party?” The monsters would pop up in identical formation for as long as the dungeon lasted. Two bear-looking things, say, and a serpent-like creature. Bears on the left, snake on the right. Their pixelated spells and attacks predictable. Our tactics for defeating them equally preset. The random encounters held some variation—maybe the bears would show up alone, or a bird-like thing would appear in the mix—but each dungeon only held so many species, so indeed, the party approaching very much resembled the party just left. Still, I watched with an attentiveness that would be almost impossible now, given the phones ever-ready at our fingertips. I watched every battle, each repetitive battle, mentally engaged if not steering the action. I wanted to provide that moral support: We were in the dungeon together.</p>
<p>And at the ends of the dungeons came the rewards: a boss fight, a plot twist, a treasure chest of rare items. Something that made all the common fights worth it, a light at the end of the hour-long tunnel. I’d sit up on the couch, take a bite of pancake. We’d watch the story move on, feeling gratified. Knowing how much pleasure this brought made it all the more dispiriting to think about my dad sitting there, grinding, murmuring to himself, “Didn’t we just leave this party?” during the five-day workweek. There is so little freshness in a grind.</p>
<p>Recently I was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, a sort of repetitive stress injury. Since I type a lot for work, and since that’s one motion that can aggravate the nerves in my damaged shoulder, one friend suggested a software that fills in frequently-typed phrases for users based on shortcuts they program. Thinking about this was a comfort. It also made me realize how many times I will need to type certain phrases over the course of a week, a career, or a lifetime. Small, recurring actions: we call this “the grind.” “Back to the daily grind,” we say. And we hope it adds up, accumulates to something, instead of just wearing us down.</p>
<p>I was going to write about how, when formulating ideas about grinding last month, two specific monsters came to mind. One from <em>FFVII</em>, long-limbed and green. One from <em>Legaia, </em>a Xenomorph-style creature with an abdomen like an insect that shoots shining beams. How these stand out in my memory because Dad impressed upon me how many he had to defeat to get where he wanted to go, to unlock what needed unlocking. In <em>FFVII, </em>it was money he was after—the green things paid more than anything else in the area where he spent the week voluntarily quarantined. In <em>Legaia</em>, it was a spell—if your heroes defeated certain enemies, they could acquire special powers. But to do this, they had to defeat those enemies again and again and again. Whether it’s based on luck or sheer numbers, I don’t know. But I remember Dad telling me he wandered the dungeon for hours defeating that thing. To look up their names, I turned to Google. I remembered the <em>Legaia </em>one vaguely—Alura? Alulu? Something like that?—and so quickly found it: Aluru. As for the <em>FFVII </em>one, I had no idea, and thus found myself scrolling through a gallery of every monster from the game, searching for its likeness. Clicking images to enlarge them, racking my brain, then scrolling: a small, repetitive motion, a grind. I finally found it: Head Hunter. He must have killed hundreds of those.</p>
<p>My dad worked in a restaurant, an arena that, based on my own work in such settings, can be saturated with repetitive actions. Maybe no job is immune to this, no life. We all have our routines. The small ways that we grind. That’s what this was going to be about—the questions, “Does it add up?” and “If so, to what?” Because despite its repetitiveness, grinding does add up, at least in games—to levels, to earnings, to new skills. This was going to be about finding meaning in the daily, the unglamorous, the Everything-But-The-Boss-Fight/Plot-Twist. Because life asks for so much of this.</p>
<p>But in fact, ending on the image of my father’s beanbag chair grind sessions mirroring his five-day workweek—how both supported me as a child, made life easier for me, and how unwitting I was to how cyclical his days must have felt, even as it dawned on me slowly throughout high school—isn’t what I want to do. We all have our grinds, true: some that increase our skills, some that weaken our joints. (Some, perhaps, that do both.) But maybe our grinds aren’t what define us, but how we break from them.</p>
<p>My childhood consisted of a lot more than sitting on the couch with the blanket and the cat, happy as those memories are. Since this is about video games, I’ll focus on a video game. But there were parks and oceans and all kinds of other things. Though life demands grinds, we get to punctuate them with our own stories and plot twists.</p>
<p>On the weekends, we would also go to the arcade. This was the site of a major plot twist: the two of us learning to bond. When I was very young, my dad and I didn’t know how to relate to each other. I think we were both a little scared of each other. We didn’t know how to laugh. It wasn’t until <em>Sailor Moon </em>hit airwaves in English that something clicked. He had raised me on <em>Starblazers </em>dubs recorded during his college days. Here was an anime I could call my own. He smiled. I smiled. A bridge.</p>
<p>And what did the Sailor Scouts love to do more than anything on their weekends (away from school and their own repeating monsters)? Go to the arcade. So, what did I want to do more than anything on the weekend? Indeed: go to the arcade. Dad smiled. I smiled. At ski ball. At go-karts. But most of all, at <em>Galaxy Force II. </em></p>
<p>Designed as a cockpit that rotated with your steering, <em>Galaxy Force II</em> was unlike anything I’d played before, or since. In contrast to games I see now in arcades, where you sit on a bench and swivel a cannon but remain essentially fixed in place, <em>Galaxy Force II </em>required you to strap in, positioning you at the center of a gyroscope that could spin nearly upside-down. With every jolt of the wheel that controlled the spaceship-avatar, the machine spun players this way and that. My 10-year-old hair loosened from its elastic tie and scattered all over the place. It was, in a word, engrossing.</p>
<p>Dad would press quarters into my outstretched palm as we barrel-rolled through lava spurts and enemy fire. I say “we” because Dad would watch from the sidelines, shouting encouragement. Backseat driving. That moral support: we were in space together. And when I’d climb out, hair like a rat’s nest, we’d smile. In fact, we’d laugh.</p>
<p>As children, we are somewhat exempt from grinds. Every year brings a new grade, new teachers, new subjects. Looking back, as I rub my own shoulder, I know my dad must have had repetitive days. Days where he muttered, “Swear I just left this party.” However, he found ways to leaven those stretches, never letting them deplete more than they provided. Never letting them feel wearying without also bringing meaning, without adding up to something wanted. We made our own plot twists amidst the day-to-day. Wandered these terrains together.</p>
