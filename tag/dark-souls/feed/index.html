								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In celebration of Jess Jenkins’ upcoming chapbook</em><span>, </span><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/prepare-to-die/" title="Prepare to Die">Prepare to Die</a><em>, I’m playing through </em><span>Dark Souls </span><em>and writing about my deaths for the month of September and maybe beyond. Check out the first dispatch <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/09/03/ready-1/" title="I Am Not Ready #1">here</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19]</p>
<p><span>This game doesn’t fuck around.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span>What I have come to realize is that </span><em>Dark Souls</em><span> requires a certain amount of “farming,” which is a term most commonly used by players of massively-multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). It’s relatively simple: repeat a (hopefully) simple and (possibly) easy task until one has acquired a certain necessary amount of something before moving on into the game. Sometimes one farms for gold or a particular item that will be of use. In </span><em>Dark Souls</em><span>, one farms for the souls themselves, as they are the world&#8217;s currency and take place of &#8220;experience,&#8221; the nebulous number in many RPGs that relates to leveling-up, better statistics, more power.</span></p>
<p><span>I spend an entire half-hour session simply farming the same eight or so entry-level enemies until I have an admirable collection of souls. The positive note is that I do not die once in accomplishing that task. I now own an item repair kit and some new armor that will become damaged with each new death and yet somehow remain affixed to my body as I awaken once more.</span></p>
<p><span>I have given away all my souls to a man who looks like he is completely desiccated and now I am ready to die again and again.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>[20][21]</p>
<p><span>I lose all 3000 souls I gained from killing this massive creature called the Taurus Demon. I haven’t been quite this sad in a long while.</span></p>
<p><span>[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]</span></p>
<p><span>I go on a suicide run to get back the souls I had lost in a previous encounter with this Black Knight. It goes well. Sort of.</span></p>
<p><span>[29][30][31][32][33]</span></p>
<hr />
<p><em>Dark Souls</em><span> has a distinct lack of narrative. There are a few opening cinematics but beyond that there is almost no direction as to where one is supposed to go. No NPC handing you a quest—kill </span><span>X</span><span> number of forest creatures in exchange for </span><span>Y</span><span>, and then go to NPC </span><span>Z</span><span>, who has another interesting proposal for you, and so on, and so on—so instead I am left to wandering, mostly to my demise. Except for the Undead Burg, the decrepit castle where I found the Taurus Demon and the Black Knight, other places tend to kill me almost immediately. I walk down a staircase and I giant ogre-esque creature one-shots me with what looks like a tree trunk. I wander down a path that hugs a steep valley and find what looks like the remains of a dragon clinging to the cliff. It looks burnt-out, desiccated. I step nearer. I step nearer. My wife is standing next to the TV, watching, telling me not to. I have to. I’m curious.</span></p>
<p><span>The dragon awakes and kills me with one fingernail.</span></p>
<p><span>[34]</span></p>
<hr />
<p>I kill the Black Knight by accidentally getting him stuck inside a small tower. He can’t advance on me and instead of trying to block my attacks, he tries to walk back through a threshold that was apparently one-way. I hack at him until he hies.</p>
<p><span>I feel a little bad about using this little exploit to make my kill, but then again I don’t at all. It wasn’t my fault.</span></p>
<p><span>One takes whatever advantage they can with this game.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span>Case in point: when in human form, another </span><em>Dark Souls</em><span> player can invade your world and kill you to harvest the souls you currently carry. It’s an inconvenience at best, and it’s been one of the primary reasons I haven’t spent much of the game “alive.” Today, however, I need something in-game that requires being in human form, and as soon as I complete that mission, my world is invaded. I run out onto the bridge where the dragon lingers and his fires kills the invader. He dies by the same fire that took me so many times. I feel a sliver of control. I made this fire to kill another. I take the invader’s Humanity. I now have three. Three humanities. That should feel good, but it kind of doesn’t.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In celebration of Jess Jenkins&#8217; upcoming chapbook</em>, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/prepare-to-die/" title="Prepare to Die">Prepare to Die</a><em>, I&#8217;m playing through </em>Dark Souls <em>and writing about my deaths for the month of September and maybe beyond.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The first thing I notice how tiny my character’s head is—is there an option to build a man without such a small head in comparison to the general ripped-ness of his body? I am very much the opposite, and I would like my character to be more like myself. I wonder, small head or not, if they are as afraid of dying as I am.</p>
<p>I think I will be a hunter. I like bows in video games. They are quiet and require more skill than guns or magic that hones in on a target. I like the extraordinarily unrealistic speed at which bow-wielding characters in video games can switch to their swords. The bow-hands disappear and are replaced by sword-hands.</p>
<p>I have a found the solution to my character’s small-head problem by making him “Top-heavy.” I am, for only a brief moment, tempted by the “Tiny Head” option. That’s a small fucking head.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/i-am-not-ready-1.jpg"><img src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/i-am-not-ready-1.jpg" alt="i-am-not-ready-1" width="2010" height="1344" /></a></p>
<p>The “Receding” hair option looks most like myself but fuck that, I’m going “Wild.” Wild and silver—one thing I will never be and another that I absolutely will. I’ll go bald before I go silver.</p>
<p>I name my character Lafayette after the protagonist from a failed novel. I do believe I am ready to die now.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of my least favorite things in games is the tutorial: how best to instruct gamers how to play the game. This game does an okay job. There are messages on the floor that tell me to press R1 to attack, hold circle to sprint, as though that’s something that needs any training whatsoever.</p>
<p>I make a bonfire and then walk through a big set of doors and then I die for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p>There is an Asylum Demon there towering two stories and with a hammer big as my top-heavy hunter. Only in my second life do I realize that upon his entrance, a door opens on the opposite side of the room. I survive the second time around. I am learning from my dying.</p>
<hr />
<p>These messages have turned out to be more than tutorials—they seem to be left there by other players who have traversed these places long before me. I see inscriptions that read, “Sorrow ahead.” Or, “Good luck.” When I see one that says, “I did it!” I know to turn back and double-check that I saved the game.</p>
<hr />
<p> In trying to learn how to shoot my newly-acquired bow, I am killed.</p>
<p><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p>In trying to learn how to shoot my nearly-acquired bow, I realize that I have no arrows for it. Every time I tried to fire, my character shakes his head, as if he can&#8217;t understand why he feels compelled to reach for something that does not exist. That he can&#8217;t believe the audacity of it. It makes me wonder if video game avatars are meant to be partially self-aware of the fact that they exist within a video game. That their world is bound by different constructs than ours, different constants. That they fall differently than humans do. That if I die I will not reawaken at my last bonfire.</p>
<p>I don’t remember when my last bonfire was. I was probably a kid. I don’t want to go all the way back there, even it if means I could keep living. The game has taught me that it&#8217;s very difficult to make your way back to where you died in the same shape that you were the first time around. I like my life. I don&#8217;t think I could pull this off a second time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Turns out I need to equip the arrows before I could use them effectively. Makes sense.</p>
<p>I kill the skeletons but am then forced to battle a knight. It doesn&#8217;t go great.</p>
<p><strong>[3]</strong></p>
<p>I try to kill the Asylum Demon from above like the message suggested. I must have hit the wrong button.</p>
<p><strong>[4]</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>“Humanity” is an important element within the game. It is a consumable item that can be found in chests or on the corpses of things like rats. Every time I die, my character loses his humanity and becomes “hollow.” Gaunt, zombielike face—essentially, the very things I spend my time killing. In order to stop being hollow, I have to consume one Humanity. Apparently one can play through the entire game while hollow, although I’m not sure that’s quite my style. I like being among the living. I like the face of the character I made, not his dehydrated counterpart. But Humanity is expensive: it is rare and there is much dying. I was prepared but perhaps not completely so.</p>
<p><strong>[5][6]</strong></p>
