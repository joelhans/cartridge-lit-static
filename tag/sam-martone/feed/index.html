								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second half in a two-part conversation with Sam Martone, author of the chapbook <a title="An Object You Cannot Lose" href="https://cartridgelit.com/an-object-you-cannot-lose/"><em>An Object You Cannot Lose</em></a>. Check out <a title="One Player’s Guide: A Conversation with Sam Martone" href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/02/09/one-players-guide-a-conversation-with-sam-martone/">the first half</a> before descending here.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Joel Hans: In <em>Smash</em>, every playable character is a kind of archetype, right? You step into their body are allowed to live through them for a few moments, as you say, which is a thrilling experience. <em>An Object You Cannot Lose</em> exists very much within that space—our narrator is more a vacancy that begs us to jump inside. Do you tend to prefer archetype more in your work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sam Martone:</strong> I don&#8217;t know if I prefer it so much as I&#8217;m just not very good with character, or at least, with the complex characters that are often sought after in workshop. I don&#8217;t think I really understand how to write characters like that, even though as a reader I feel like I can distinguish between archetypal characters and more realistic ones. I&#8217;d say what I hope happens with my stories is something in between—I don&#8217;t really want to write purely realistic stories, but I also don&#8217;t want the characters to simply be a vehicle for fantastical plot elements. I want real-feeling characters who have weird, otherworldly stuff happen to them—I&#8217;m still figuring out how to pull that off, though.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Daugherty: Speaking of immersion, your writing here is also so immersive, creating a trance of sorts as I read. Is this something that occurs to you as you write? Is great writing atmospheric in this way, creating a sense that the reader is a part of what&#8217;s happening? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> That&#8217;s really nice to hear! The events of the game and the stories aren&#8217;t particularly unusual, so I wanted the prose itself hypnotic and absorbing. Various images and ideas repeat themselves over and over again. I like to think of these pieces as both game and guide, so I tried to capture the weird ways the game it&#8217;s based on (<em>Dragon Quest V</em>) pushes you along and makes sure the story keeps going. Unlike today&#8217;s sandbox games, <em>DQV</em> keeps you on such a particular path that some of your interactions with the world amount to nonsense. At other times, as when you know someone&#8217;s going to die but have to let it happen to move the story forward, it can be pretty devastating—you feel culpable, because sure, you could simply stay on this screen and not progress forever, thus saving your father, but you want to continue, to see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>JH: The difference between sandbox games and games &#8220;on rails&#8221; is such a controversial thing in the gaming world right now—I&#8217;m curious about which you, at this point, prefer. Or perhaps something in the middle. Does that preference come down to the sheer mechanics of it (the relative ease of playing), or is it because of the engagement with character/story?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>I&#8217;m not sure actually. Maybe due to a combination of what systems I&#8217;ve had and my comfort with more directive games, I haven&#8217;t actually spent much time playing open-world games. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d probably get really into them, but I also feel content playing simple top-down RPGs. I&#8217;m still a pretty avid <em>Pokémon</em> player, and the story in those games is basically the same with every installment, fun but forgettable. The depth of that game comes more from the mechanics of breeding and training <em>Pokémon</em>—the possibilities here are pretty endless. Maybe what I&#8217;m drawn to is simply a wide variety of complex ways to play an on-the-surface easy game (<em>Smash Bros.</em> falls into this category too). Also, games I like usually have big collecting components, and I&#8217;m basically just a sucker for collecting things.</p>
<p><strong>JD: What are you obsessions in your writing? What sorts of themes or subjects are you most interested in? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> Good question. I guess I&#8217;m pretty obsessed with obsession. Generally in my fiction the characters are collectors or creators of some kind and totally driven by that, or they&#8217;re hung up on a particular idea, trying to figure out how to deal with it or escape from it—now that I say this, it kind of sounds like I&#8217;m describing fiction in general. My stories also tend to wear disguises, solve mysteries, hang around with monsters.</p>
<p><strong>JH: Obsession is a distressed version of the most basic need in traditional storytelling, which generally equates to: the hero needs a particular something—an object, a talisman—in order to survive, whereas in strict literary fiction, they wants seem more intangible, right? Role-playing games and traditional storytelling tend toward the object, I think. So I&#8217;m really curious about how you take a journey that leads toward an object, or objects—as referenced in your title—and skew or complicate them in a way that makes it seem more literary? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>Huh, that&#8217;s a great way of distinguishing literary fiction and genre fiction that I&#8217;ve never really thought of before. While there are definitely sought-after tangible objects in <em>An Object You Cannot Lose</em> and the pieces that follow, I hope the intangible wants take precedence when reading—they are, after all, more interesting and probably more relevant to the reader than a legendary sword or a magic ring. What happens as the story progresses is the logic of the game world becomes that intangible object of desire—to be able to save multiple files so you don&#8217;t make a wrong decision, to bring people back from the dead and so on—and what the story is leading to, instead of the magical items you obtain for beating the final boss, is the end of the game, which is also the return to the real world: you can&#8217;t correct wrong decisions without consequences. Dead people stay dead. That&#8217;s the tension I hope becomes the driving force.</p>
<p><strong>JD: Where are you at in the stages of this project? What else are you working on or what are you planning on working on next? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>Still trucking along. I got sidetracked by my thesis but I&#8217;ve been picking this project up again lately. I have, I think, three more sections completed, but quite a bit more to go. As for other stuff, I think one of my biggest weaknesses as a writer is I have a difficult time deciding what to work on, so I have a lot of projects at various stages of completion, and who knows which (if any) I&#8217;ll actually finish, but some of them include: a family of hoaxers, summer camp, shape shifters, laughter removal, and Kesha.</p>
<p><strong>JD: You and Rebecca King are <em>Origami Zoo Press</em>. Your books are so wonderfully and thoughtfully made. What do you hope to accomplish as you all set out in the publishing arena? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>After the first couple <em>Origami Zoo</em> chapbooks, we really wanted to figure out how to set our press apart, and the phrase we arrived at was &#8220;obsessively beautiful books.&#8221; Rebecca and I are both obsessives in our own writing, and we wanted to give the same treatment to these lovely words we were putting out into the world. That meant everything from design and layout to deluxe editions loaded with bonus material. We also strived to make all the design work a collaborative process with the authors. I don&#8217;t know that we have any high-minded or ambitious goals beyond just that—wrapping stories and essays we love in beautiful packages to match.</p>
<p><strong>J: What writing are you most hyped about these days? Who&#8217;s really lighting fires for you? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>I just received <em>No Shape Bends the River So Long</em> by Monica Berlin &amp; Beth Marzoni in the mail and I&#8217;m so excited to read it—I&#8217;ve read some of these collaborative poems in journals and they&#8217;re absolutely captivating. I also got James Brubaker&#8217;s <em>Liner Notes for Christmas—</em>I think he shares a lot of similar concerns as I do, so pretty much anytime I see one of his stories show up, I&#8217;m usually mad I didn&#8217;t think of it first, but then they&#8217;re always so much better than anything I would&#8217;ve done with the same topic. He&#8217;s obsessive, too, and I find his encyclopedic prose really enviable—he manages to launch really thoughtful (and funny) ideas about art and music all while doing really heavy lifting in regards to character. Most anticipated for 2015: Kelly Link&#8217;s <em>Get In Trouble</em> and Adrienne Celt&#8217;s <em>Daughters</em>.</p>
<p><strong>JD: If you could design a video game and be the creative director on it, what would the game be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> I think I&#8217;d want to create a game with a compelling story and complex characters, but that was also hyperaware it was a game (so I guessMetal Gear Solid but tonally more like Community?). It&#8217;d probably be a turn-based RPG so I could actually beat it, but with all the classes being contemporary archetypes: Jock, Goth, etc. Yeah maybe an RPG set in a high school. You go through all four years! And you can, you know, become valedictorian or be a bully or both! Final boss is Prom. Has anyone done this? I want someone to now. I&#8217;ll help.</p>
<p><strong>JD: What are you playing right now? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> I forced myself to stop playing video games on weekdays because of how addicted I got to Fire Emblem Awakening. That hasn&#8217;t happened to me with a game in a long time—it&#8217;s a pretty familiar turn-based strategy game, but more interesting is all the relationship building you can do among the massive cast of characters, leading to marriage and, sometimes, kids, who you can then recruit to fight as adults through some convoluted time travel narrative. Also the new <em>Smash Bros.</em> of course, and dipping my toes into Hyrule Warriors, but the amount of content in that game is kind of overwhelming.</p>
<p><strong>JH: Interesting you say &#8220;addicted&#8221; here, rather than obsessed. Can you talk about that a little, what you might think the difference between addicted an obsessed is? Do you tend to weight one way, and your characters another?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> Now that you mention it, I don&#8217;t really think of myself as an addictive person and as a result I never really write characters who are. Most of the time, with games I&#8217;m really obsessed with like <em>Pokémon</em> and <em>Smash Bros.</em>, playing the one-player mode gets old pretty fast. I usually play an hour and feel set. With <em>Fire Emblem</em>, I was leaving social events just to go home and play, staying up until 4 a.m., etc. I&#8217;m already mapping out my next playthrough, who&#8217;ll marry who, etc. It was great fun, but with classes starting it would&#8217;ve gotten to be a problem, though I think my use of &#8220;addiction&#8221; here is still an exaggeration, whereas I never really see obsession as a problem. Obsession is necessary, even. I think my life would be very boring if I weren&#8217;t obsessed with all that I&#8217;m obsessed with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help celebrate the publication of Sam Martone&#8217;s chapbook, <em><a title="An Object You Cannot Lose" href="https://cartridgelit.com/an-object-you-cannot-lose/" target="_blank">An Object You Cannot Lose</a></em>, we fired off some pixels to the author, and he lobbied some others back in return.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Justin Daugherty: What was the initial impetus behind this project? What made you want to tackle a book-length collection inspired by a video game? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sam Martone:</strong> I started writing these pieces when I&#8217;d just moved across the country to Arizona and, without internet or friends yet, I spent a lot of time avoiding the 118 degree heat and playing my Nintendo DS. The first piece (&#8220;Open Water&#8221;) was really just intended to be a one-shot. Eventually I wrote a second, which Lauren Becker took for <em>Corium</em>, and her very kind acceptance letter made me feel like I should keep working on them. And so I did. For years before, I&#8217;d always liked the idea of writing a novel in the form of a player&#8217;s guide, but could never figure out how to go about it. Then about ten pieces into this project, I realized I was probably doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Joel Hans: I wanted to ask you about Arizona, because it has a strangeness to its environment that feels almost game-like to me, having recently moved here from the Midwest. Saguaro cacti and dirt and all this heat—everything is threatening at best, but most likely deadly. Did you feel that at all while crafting these pieces?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> Oh yeah, Arizona and its climate are definitely driving forces in these pieces. The summer I moved here I kept thinking to myself, &#8220;Who would build a city in the middle of a desert?&#8221; But it is really beautiful, too—I&#8217;ve lived in a number of places, but Arizona is unlike anywhere else. Arriving here felt like entering a totally alien landscape. Even after three years, it&#8217;s surreal to look past the buildings and see mountains along every horizon.</p>
<p><strong>JD: What does the intersection between literature and video games mean for y</strong>ou?</p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>For me, I&#8217;ve always been more into video games for the story than anything else (even when those stories aren&#8217;t particularly good). I&#8217;ve never been good at games that require, say, quick reflexes or aiming or what have you, so for me it&#8217;s always been a vehicle for exciting, compelling, if not totally coherent, story.</p>
<p><strong>JH: To step away from your writing for a moment—how are you relating, based on this preference, to the game scene of today? Do you feel like there&#8217;s a lack of the kinds of games that you&#8217;re interested in, or are you just focusing your time into a genre that&#8217;s not your absolute favorite?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>Well, up until recently I didn&#8217;t even have a console from this generation (or last generation for that matter), so my connection to the current game world was purely through the Nintendo DS and 3DS, which I don&#8217;t think are particularly representative of some of the most popular kinds of games right now. I think the limitations on handheld games, even though those limitations are becoming fewer and fewer, still preserve a lot of the simple, solitary, strange experiences I most appreciate. I have very little interest in online play—I was so disappointed when <em>Dragon Quest X</em> was essentially online only. That&#8217;s not really what I want from a game, though that seems to be the way the culture is going as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>JD: This type of writing responds to a pop cultural artifact, but must be it&#8217;s own animal. How do you think a writer makes it new? How did you approach the writing? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> Well, I think that previously mentioned incoherence in story also lends to what makes game stories compelling—video games, especially older ones when designers were more limited in terms of what they could do/show, have such strange internal logics, making for totally unfamiliar, surreal narratives that I don&#8217;t think could&#8217;ve arisen in traditional fiction (the same way film opened up all sorts of doors for stories, too). My favorite video game writing tries to transfigure that experience into something that can happen on the page—it necessarily has to change, given the medium, but is still forged from the essence. That exchange is really cool to see happening in the work of a lot of young writers right now (and of course I hope video games start taking more cues from fiction!). For me personally, since I was imitating the form of the player&#8217;s guide, I had a pretty strong foundational skeleton, but I knew it wouldn&#8217;t make for interesting stories to simply take the reader through the story of the game. Thus, the overblown melodrama of the pretty standard &#8220;hero&#8217;s journey&#8221; is set against the more mundane real world details, which, in the world of the game, are the character&#8217;s dreams. This made it a lot of fun for me to look at what a character in the game might find disturbing or unsettling about the logic of our world, and my hope is that it makes the mundane, everyday images suddenly strange and unfamiliar.</p>
<p><strong>JH: Video games are a little bit like fairy tales in that way, no? Strange internal logics that go unexplained, and ignore causality? A hero&#8217;s journey, as you say? Many of the classic SNES-era RPGs could be classified as fairy tale-like, if not more explicitly—<em>Super Mario RPG</em>, anyone? I&#8217;m curious if you have much of a history in fairy tales, or if this genuinely is a parallel that one could develop, via video games, near or completely separate from the origin material.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SM: </strong>I think a lot of the pop culture things I&#8217;m interested in have pretty clear roots in fairy tale and myth (video games, superheroes, etc.), and I&#8217;m always compelled by the various repackaging and reconstructing of those stories (the comic book Fables, for example). I think it&#8217;s pretty impossible for anyone to NOT have a history with fairy tales, and so I don&#8217;t really know that you can really untangle any story, video game or otherwise, from those roots, given just how much we&#8217;ve repurposed artistically and culturally, over and over again. I also don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily a bad thing—just seems to me to be the genetics of storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>JD: Is there other pop culture writing you&#8217;re interested in? Any other pop culture writing that really stands out to you right now? Who&#8217;s writing cool stuff? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> In general I tend to be interested in pop culture writing, though a lot of my other stories outside of this project avoid it. A lot of literary fiction has a tendency to shy away from real-world pop culture artifacts, possibly because of the way it dates the work, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s hard to write about the real world right now without including pop culture and brand names and celebrity twitters, because that&#8217;s real everyday life for a lot of us. There is a weird challenge in figuring out how to include those things to where they function beyond cheap references, but I kind of find that part of the fun. As for stuff I&#8217;m reading, there&#8217;s a lot of really fascinating work being written about pro-wrestling right now (like from Brian Oliu, without whose video game writing I probably wouldn&#8217;t have even considered games a possible subject for my own), and it&#8217;s a really different experience because I&#8217;ve never been into pro-wrestling, so I&#8217;m on the outside of that particular slice of geek culture. I just finished W. Todd Kaneko&#8217;s <em>Dead Wrestler Elegies</em> and that, along with Oliu&#8217;s work, actually makes me want to watch WWE.</p>
<p><strong>JD: One of the things that makes video games so big as a cultural obsession, I think, is the immersion that occurs between player and game. There&#8217;s a certain fantasy in myth realization. What makes video games so important to you? </strong></p>
<p><strong>SM:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s definitely true about immersion and fantasy enactment. We&#8217;ve watched movie and TV and comic book heroes all our lives, it makes sense that a medium that puts us in the heroes&#8217; shoes would be so enticing. For me, I think it is that sense of immersion and escape—I usually play to decompress after a long day or just when I&#8217;m stressed—but there&#8217;s also an essential social aspect to it, be it playing with people or just being part of the cultural conversation (the same way we talk about television shows, books, etc.). One of my favorite games, Super Smash Bros., has been a catalyst for friendships throughout my life. I definitely think playing a match of Smash against someone is a quick way to getting to know them, in all their unfiltered, swearing at the screen, trash-talking glory. As someone who&#8217;s never been great interacting with groups of people I just met, this is really important to me.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The songs on this playlist are not, by and large, directly related to video games (although the opening to Man Man’s “Knuckle Down” certainly calls to mind 16-bit dungeon trawling). Instead, this is just a set of songs I listened to a lot around when I started work on <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/an-object-you-cannot-lose/" title="An Object You Cannot Lose" target="_blank"><em>An Object You Cannot Lose</em></a>. It was my first year living in Arizona. I played Bon Iver’s second album nonstop while I wrote, due to the way its shimmering music and mostly indiscernible lyrics made for sprawling background soundscapes. I watched the “Oblivion” video over and over again for the moment at 0:41 when Grimes so earnestly lets a cautious spectator know it’s okay for him to walk in front of the camera. My initial disappointment in the simplicity of the new Rihanna single quickly changed to euphoric excitement anytime it came on the radio as I drove to friends’ apartments and movie theaters, anywhere to get away from the crushing heat. These songs are all objects I can’t lose, artifacts of that first year in this concrete desert, when I was just getting to know the people and places I’d grow to think of as home, or a kind of home, over the subsequent years. I hope listening will maybe pull you back to 2011-2012, to the memories you may carry tangled up with these songs. Or, if they’re new to you, I hope one might mean as much to you now as it did to me then.</p>
