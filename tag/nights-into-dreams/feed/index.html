								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, heck. <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/11/07/save-point-nights-dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I just wrote about <em>Nights into Dreams </em>two months ago</a>, but it’s late December as I sit down to write this, I’m home for the holidays, and all I want to think about is <em>Christmas Nights into Dreams, </em>the original game’s sampler pack from 1996. (Don’t worry. I promise I have some different thoughts on this one.)</p>
<p>Playing <em>Christmas Nights </em>is a family tradition, and it’s tradition that’s on my mind this week. More broadly, this time of year. Most years, I travel home to the Seattle area to spend time with friends and family during the winter holidays. This involves staying at my dad’s house for the majority of the trip, which means that at some point my dad will ask me, his adult daughter, “Do you want to play <em>Christmas Nights</em>?” Though I sometimes initially smile and shake my head, he unfailingly follows this up with, “It’s no trouble. I’ll set up the Sega Saturn for you,” and before I know it, there I am, holding the dusty controller in my hands, left thumb on the well-worn joystick.</p>
<p>Today my dad sits down next to me on the guest bed and watches me sail through the first level as Claris, one of the two playable characters. He watches Claris tumble through darkness to the level, Spring Valley, which has been decked out in snow and glass ornaments in alignment with the Christmas theme. He watches me steer her up the frosty hill and into the pavilion where Nights, the jester-like dream spirit, waits. The two characters merge, Claris taking on the physical form of Nights, and I take off, soaring through the snow-dazzled sky and loop-de-looping through enormous fir wreaths, drill-dashing monsters and wracking up points. Claris’s version of Spring Valley is identical in the original game but for the holiday decorations, so between the two editions, I have played this level probably, realistically, hundreds of times. I have been playing it for 21 years. Damn. If my relationship with this game were a person, it could drink.</p>
<p>I fly through Spring Valley automatically, reflexively. I know every dip and turn. My dad murmurs, “Muscle memory,” watching me swerve around projectiles I know will be spit from monster mouths, as they always are, as they always have been. Timed so precisely in this side-scrolling track that only contains so much. Muscle memory—I could do this with my eyes closed. It is as familiar as my dad’s house. Even more so—he’s lived in this place seven years. The game goes back farther than that. I have swooped through this circuit so many times.</p>
<p>What is it about tradition that appeals to me? Why do I find this so comforting? Why, when the boss can’t even touch me once, do I still draw enjoyment from this? 21 years—this friendship could drink. It could vote. It could have its own kid. Reliability? Predictability? The absence of surprises? Why is old tradition reassuring?</p>
<p>At the same time, it might not be fair to say the game goes unaltered year to year. In playing it just before sitting down to write this, I asked myself, “Why do you never play as Elliot? Why always Claris?” This is the first year I’ve critically examined this ritual, and stopping to think about it, I realized I hadn’t played as Elliot in ages. A fuzzy memory emerged of me as a child feeling frustrated because his version of Spring Valley was backwards or something, some betrayal of the contract of familiarity, routine. After swiftly finishing Claris’s four-part track with all “A” scores, I hesitantly switched to Elliot. To my surprise, his track wasn’t backwards—it was a completely different track, one not replicated in the normal edition of the game. I, the supposed master of this sampler, bumbled my way through with one A and three Bs. Then beat the same boss, which was, indeed, mirror-flipped, but otherwise identical to Claris’s. It wasn’t hard and it wasn’t frustrating. But it amused me since the whole reason I booted up the game was to reflect on the nature of tradition, of permanence, of the feelings that nestle in that.</p>
<p>Then there’s the “Open Your Presents” portion of the sampler, which also touches on the tension between reliability and divergence. In a memory game setup, the player clicks on different wrapped boxes bearing question marks that flip over to reveal different images. If you uncover two that match, you earn a prize (things like image galleries, music files, and so on). If not, they flip back over, and you must acquire new chances by replaying Spring Valley—either Claris’s or Elliot’s will do. As far as I know, the packages are ordered randomly, though of course the prizes themselves remain the same. The battery on our ancient Sega Saturn won’t let us save, so every time I play <em>Christmas Nights, </em>the matching game starts anew. I move the cursor, click, and hope. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. This adds a little drama to my visits. Furthermore, there are certain boxes that contain images of Reala, Nights’s mortal enemy. If you click on Reala, your accumulated matching chances are erased—a kind of sudden death. When that snidely smiling clown face popped up today, accompanied by sinister music, my stomach still fell in the way it did when I was an aggravated tween. This, I suppose, can be part of tradition, too—the way it uproots us, unsettles. The way we sign up to be unsettled, knowingly. Even this, sometimes, can be comforting in its endurance—its steadfastness as something that remains over time. Frustration as muscle memory.</p>
<p>Every year I loop back to Seattle like Claris/Nights looping on a track. There are places I achingly want to see, reunions that make my heart light up. I revel in the similarity, take comfort in what goes unchanged. There are times when I feel like an infant who needs reassurance of object permanence—that the people I love will still be themselves, that I, too, will still be myself in their eyes. (I catch the predictable speed-increasing gusts and reach for the programmed gold rings, the ones I could grasp with my eyes shut.) At the same time, I revel in the newness—the breaks from tradition of who-is-doing-what. If my relationship with <em>Christmas Nights </em>were a human—a friend I could gather in a coat-and-scarf embrace—I would still be learning new things about it, as I am with real loved ones. I sat down to write about tradition but realize the actual insight here is that even the things we think we know best can turn and change and surprise us. That familiar touchstones are still intact, but it is arrogant to think they don’t move, that they can’t roll or crack open. That this tradition, written in pixels and air, requires my attention, my engagement.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was teaching, and my usually vibrant late-morning class was inexplicably glum. Students drooped over the fronts of their desks, eyes downcast. My PowerPoint slides and carefully planned discussion questions were met with shrugs and glances out the window. Finally, I stopped. Something clearly wasn’t working. “What’s wrong today?” I asked. “Everyone seems so sleepy.” Sometimes acknowledging this helps—reminds them I am human, that I get tired too. Pausing to recognize our shared march through a semester with too much work and too little sleep can lift the unspoken frustration hovering around us like fog.</p>
<p>Their response was different this time, though. As with times when I’ve called out the elephant of fatigue in the room, dozens of heads nodded in unison. But this time, the affirmation followed one student’s comment of, “Half the country is on fire.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” another echoed. “The Columbia River Gorge is burning, and we’ve had, like, three hurricanes this month.”</p>
<p>“It feels like the end of the world.”</p>
<p>I’ve wondered what to do about this. This: the swirling chaos outside the classroom. My regular approach has been to set it aside as best I can, to try to give them a break from the churning news cycle while equipping them with skills to rejoin the fray. I do this out of anxiety as much as compassion. When I teach, to some extent, I perform, put on a persona. The persona isn’t untrue. But it isn’t vulnerable, either. To eschew descending eyelids, I prance and gesticulate and cry things like “Holy cats!” while putting my hands on the sides of my face like a grown-up Shirley Temple. I do this to disguise myself. I try to buoy us.</p>
<p>But sometimes this doesn’t work. The weight of things just past the closed door leans and oozes in. And I’ve read that it’s better to recognize them. To not try to grin them away. I recently read this: that it matters, to students, that you name the mass shooting, name the catastrophe, name the fill-in-the-blank. I hesitate because I fear my own reactions to these things, because I fear letting my despair show. Because sometimes I still feel like I need a mentor, but that in this setting, I am the mentor. I sometimes don’t know what I need to hear, much less what I should say.</p>
<p>But on this day I pause. I say, “Yes.” Shut the textbook and let the persona slip, just for a minute. “It’s hard,” I say. “It’s sad.” I wish I could tell them the Gorge will rebloom like scorched land at the end of a movie. I wish I could tell them the hurricanes will lessen, that we can reverse the damage we’ve done as a species if we just stick together.</p>
<p>There are days when it feels like the end of the world to me, too. So what do I say to these students?</p>
<p>Last spring, a family member sent me to a Tarot reader. How much stock I put in Tarot varies, but I went with an open mind. At least, I think, divinations can be Rorschach tests, revealing through the reactions they provoke as much as the predictions themselves. Unlike in past readings, where I’d had a specific question, in spring I came as a blank slate. “I’m willing to receive any wisdom,” I thought. But still, without realizing it, I unconsciously hoped for insight pertaining to my personal life—marriage, friendships, artistic endeavors. I rarely think of work when I read my horoscope, draw a card, or meditate. Work feels separate from spiritual inquiry. For this reason, the reading surprised me.</p>
<p>Card after card related to teaching, to the role of the counselor. “Your job right now,” the reader said, “is to not let the young ones despair.”</p>
<p>But how can I help the young ones not despair when I’m fighting to resist that quicksand myself? What can sit in place of despair on the days when hope feels futile?</p>
<p>For the past month I’ve been thinking about <em>Nights into Dreams, </em>a Sega Saturn game from 1996. At the start of <em>Nights, </em>two children experience nightmares that force them to relive their own brushes with despair. For a girl named Claris, this comes in the form of a botched audition for the solo part in an upcoming concert. Despite her hard work and devotion to music, she freezes up under the glaring stage lights and succumbs to her fear of the panel of judges, who tap pencils impatiently and scoff. For Eliot, it comes when an older boy bests him at basketball in front of his friends, then chucks the ball into his stomach and laughs. At the end of each nightmare, the antagonists morph from human judges and bullies into horned demons with red eyes. They chase the children through misty green corridors until, at last, there is a light at the end. The light turns out to be Nights.</p>
<p>Leading the rebellion against a villain named Wizeman who seeks to enter the human world through dreams, Nights is a sprite who can merge with humans to push back the tide of evil as long as they retain one important quality. While Wizeman’s minions can rob sleeping humans of many “Ideyas”—floating colored spheres representing qualities such as purity, wisdom, hope, and intelligence that could be used against him—the one thing they cannot touch is the red Ideya of courage. At the start of each playable sequence, we see Claris or Elliot literally fall from consciousness into sleep, where the level of their dream awaits. Though they start each descent with five Ideyas circling around them, Wizeman’s monsters rush forward and strip them of all but their courage just before they touch the ground. Still, with that one bright circle orbiting around them, the children are able to fuse with Nights and soar through the air, reclaiming the stolen Ideyas and overcoming bosses, including, eventually, Wizeman.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, Claris and Eliot return to the sites of their initial nightmares to face their fears. When their respective antagonists approach, they steel themselves, closing their fists over their hearts, which glow briefly with red. In each of their concluding sequences, they confront their challenges undaunted, with Claris being awarded the solo and Elliot impressing the older boys with a slam dunk. In both cases, courage is framed as the untouchable quality—the thing that remains when all else has been taken.</p>
<p>When I played <em>Nights </em>at age 10, this lesson felt vital: Courage, yes, the untouchable thing. I was persuaded to face some of my own fears, wearing this story like a talisman. Yet even then, I questioned whether courage was always the needed quality—the surest, most necessary quality. <em>Shouldn’t something come before courage? </em>I wondered. And still, I wonder this. When everything feels taken from me, I’m not sure that what’s left is courage. I don’t know the name for what remains.</p>
<p>Being English graduate students interested in children’s literature, my friend and I experienced synchronized mini-meltdowns in 2012 when we watched <em>Rise of the Guardians, </em>a film in which characters must identify their “center” in order to win the day. One character’s is wonder. Another’s is joy. The center represents the core of their power, the thing that most closely defines them. We weren’t sure what ours were. About this, I wonder too.</p>
<p>What is left when the chips are truly down? When half of the country is on fire? Is it wishful thinking to rely on the presence of a “something” that shines in our fists or our hearts? A “center” that circles around us? I say to my students, “I feel that way too, sometimes, like the world is ending, but we have to keep going as if it won’t. And we have to do our part to make sure it doesn’t.” Awareness of the fact that many people through many generations have believed the world is ending: is that a form of hope? Or a slightly offbeat sibling? Is fatalistic hope the same thing as courage?</p>
<p>I want to believe I can get better at this, that we can face fears, rewrite nightmares. That maybe a center isn’t innate, but something decisive and constructed. I want to have answers for the nervous window-glancers, for the young ones looking for their future. I want to think maybe it isn’t emotion that steps in and lifts the roofs shattered by despair—that maybe it’s action. After all, it isn’t the glow that rewrites things. It’s what comes next that counts.</p>
