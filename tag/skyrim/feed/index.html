								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Marissa Landrigan is the author of </em> The Vegetarian&#8217;s Guide to Eating Meat: A Young Woman&#8217;s Search for Ethical Food. <em>Her</em><em> creative nonfiction has appeared in numerous publications, including  </em>The Atlantic<em>, </em>Creative Nonfiction<em>, </em>Salon<em>, </em>Guernica<em>, </em>Orion<em>, </em>The Rumpus<em>, and elsewhere. She writes a monthly column for Paste online called “Breaking Vegetarian,” curates the food-themed reading series Acquired Taste, and holds an MFA in Creative Writing &amp; Environment from Iowa State University. An Assistant Professor of Writing at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, she can be found online at <a href="http://marissalandrigan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marissalandrigan.com</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Marissa Landrigan&#8217;s story, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/01/27/mara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Mara,&#8221;</a> appeared in our  </em>Inter++sections <em>Temple Issue. Below, she talks with editor A.A. Balaskovits about same-sex relationships, writing nonfiction, and message-board misogyny.</em></p>
<p><strong>Your story for us, </strong>“<strong>Mara,</strong>”<strong> is so wonderful because you flesh out the humanity in the game, which I think is something the Elder Scrolls struggles with at times. What made you want to highlight romance in this world?</strong></p>
<p>Skyrim was the first video game I’d ever really played, and the aspect of it that most intrigued me from the beginning was the extent to which I had choice as a player. I could wander and roam the (incredibly-rendered) landscape for hours, just riding my horse or performing random side quests. And when I eventually got to the point where I could have followers, and eventually, marry them, I was in awe at the prospect of a same-sex marriage in this world. It was so casual—less than casual, really. The game, being a program, didn’t have any opinion whatsoever about whether my female player-character married a female non-player-character. Given the way in which gender and sexual orientation choices are restricted in the physical world of modern America, to have such a choice, and to have it be such a non-issue, felt pretty revolutionary. I think this is why I became so attached to my game wife, Brelyna, and so enamored of playing the marriage as a significant component of the game: the way I could bring her gifts, the way she spoke so affectionately to my player-character. The romance possibilities of the Elder Scrolls world felt so much more permissive than the physical world, and I really wanted to explore that.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that games where social stigmas are not present</strong><strong>—or rather, not programmed in, as they have to be created—are giving us a hope for what could be, even if the game takes place in the past or in a magical world? Does that take away from the, dare I say it in reference to Skyrim, realism?</strong></p>
<p>I really do think so. I know people who play games because they feel the player-character gives them license to occupy some unexplored or stigmatized part of themselves, and I can see how that kind of liberation could ripple out into the physical world. For example, I identify as bisexual, but am in a happy, heterosexual marriage, so a player-character in a lesbian marriage was a fun, no-stakes way to explore that aspect of my sexual orientation. I don’t think this takes away from the realism of the game at all; in fact, you could argue that kind of freedom allows the game to be truer than my “real” life.</p>
<p><strong>What really spoke to me about your story was that it was about a pretty healthy relationship</strong><strong>—something we don’t often see in literature (but ironically we do in video games sometimes). Was that something you consciously thought about when setting down to write this?</strong></p>
<p>That was honestly exactly my intention. Once I discovered that Skyrim enabled player-characters to marry non-player-characters, and specifically allowed same-sex partnerships, I wanted to see how others had chosen their game mates, and what kinds of relationships had emerged, so I went to the message boards. And wow, was that a mistake. What I saw there were lots of people making (predictably) sexist and misogynist assessments of Brelyna (among other NPCs) as a wife. In debating the relative merits of marrying various female NPCs, I read offensive comments like “all she’s good for is the cooking,” and “have you seen her without her hood, she fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down,” standard objectification like “all female characters have nice bodies under their armor,” and complaints about a lack of sex from the NPC. But I also found threads of people discussing how much fun they were having with the game loophole that offers no punishment for abusing one’s spouse (“Behind closed doors I can thrash the living daylights out of my wife and she never rats me out to the guards”) and threads seeking and offering advice for the best way to murder one’s game wife without getting caught or punished for murder, and while maintaining the ability to marry again. Basically, I was all excited because I thought the game had created this sort of utopia where same-sex marriage was possible and no big deal, and then I crashed into the reality that a (mostly male) player base was still being sexist and gross about imaginary female characters. So I decided to write an ode to Brelyna, a celebration of her beauty, and her power, and her history, as a sort of counter to all that, and, maybe an illustration of one positive difference between (most) male and female gamers.</p>
<p><strong>What you are working on currently? </strong></p>
<p>My current work is all about science (can you tell I’m a huge nerd yet?)! <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vegetarians-Guide-Eating-Meat-Ethical/dp/1771642742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My first book</a> is coming out in just a few weeks, and it’s a personal narrative that focuses on the idea of eating meat ethically. Naturally, for my second book, I wanted to make things more complicated, so I’m working on a proposal for a book that asks whether it’s ethical to eat plants; new research suggests that plants are capable of feeling pain, forming relationships, and communicating with each other, so I hope to explore the ethical implications of considering plants as “conscious.”</p>
<p><strong>I’m totally into your first book, and I love that idea for the second one. Can you give us an insight into your research and how you became interested in these topics?</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite things about being a creative nonfiction writer is that it allows me to explore any subject I randomly become interested in. So, feeling an urge to read lots of books about Norse mythology? I’ll write an essay on it, and then it’s work! This is really how I came to write my first book: I’d been a vegetarian for about seven years and, while living in Iowa for grad school, met some farmers who were making me reconsider. I had lots of questions, lots I wanted to learn, lots of ethical considerations to work through, so naturally, I turned to writing to help me figure it all out! My next book project was actually my editor’s idea. Greystone Books, my publisher, just recently published the English translation of Peter Wohlleben’s <em>The Hidden Life of Trees</em>, and Jen suggested that this idea of tree and plant communication might have some implications for vegetarians, and wondered if I might be interested in exploring that. I was hooked—it’s a natural extension of my work on the first book, and is giving me the chance to return to scientific research, which I’ve always loved writing about in narrative form.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Main Character Disease</strong></p>
<p>“What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets?”<br />
— Dracula, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</p>
<p>My flesh is an inorganic compound,<br />
pixels and rearranged numbers.</p>
<p>An electric baptism: my hardwiring<br />
gutted, pouring out fizzes and hisses.</p>
<p>Secrets champagne out of me<br />
and into ambient binary. Rubber capillaries</p>
<p>spring out like frayed yarn, and, oh<br />
God what a joy to be so exposed</p>
<p>and misunderstood: the tenderest<br />
corners of my kidneys rendered</p>
<p>for your viewing pleasure. Another millenia<br />
of slaying vamps and looting castles.</p>
<p>During pause screens, I shadowbox demons.<br />
During off time, my pantomime murders</p>
<p>do not end. When I die, and I will die,<br />
I am revived from nothing—again—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Female Character Disease</strong></p>
<p>“Endure and survive.”<br />
— Ellie, The Last of Us</p>
<p>A dream in which I am<br />
a talking lamp</p>
<p>with breasts. Pixelated<br />
and sharp,</p>
<p>when I hug those whom<br />
I’m made to reward,</p>
<p>I leave a deep wound.<br />
And between you and me,</p>
<p>nothing should be as crammable<br />
as putty,</p>
<p>but when asked<br />
what I mean to you</p>
<p>you didn’t blink once;<br />
your nose didn’t wrinkle.</p>
<p>The snow touched everything<br />
but you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Archetypal Villain Disease</strong></p>
<p>“What is better—to be good, or to overcome your nature through great effort?”<br />
— Paarthurnax, Skyrim</p>
<p>What gave me away—the overabundance<br />
of lack,</p>
<p>rusted shackles for teeth,<br />
a scowl like blasting jelly?</p>
<p>My problem is I just think better<br />
with a pixelated cigarette in my mouth.</p>
<p>Knowing you is like sipping<br />
methadone,</p>
<p>a high that ends like the hiccups.<br />
So what if my spine is a big</p>
<p>gummy worm? The god in me knows<br />
no winter, instead my mouth</p>
<p>is a shucked oyster shell in which<br />
you supplant my tongue with a pearly</p>
<p>magnet, this head a cocktail of diseased<br />
chemicals drawn into your polarizing waters.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are walking, suddenly, along a road. Ancient slabs of stone, weathered and broken, smoothed over by footsteps. How many years? Since they built this road, ancients muttering in a language no one will hear again, buried so long in the earth that they are the earth. The dirt that covers over these stones is singing a song that you have always and never heard. You choose your steps across these stones carefully, forgetful of the complex maneuvers necessary to place one foot—there—in front of the other, to leap over this tree that has fallen across the road—when?—to reach into your pack and consult your map.</p>
<p>How many years? Since last you were here. You try to follow the road but you can only stop, look at the sky, at the flowers—colors you’ve never seen in waking, colors you can feel but not name, colors you have dreamt, colors you have assigned to the talons and tail feathers of creatures you thought existed as a child, before growing up and learning better.</p>
<p>How many miles? Must you walk along this road before you reach home. You do not look where you are going—you fall from a ridge into a lake. When you look up, you remember this feeling. The sky dismembered by waves and angles and prisms. You remember this, grasping for solid land, searching for “up” as if it were some lost treasure. You remember a jewel glimmering red as an “OFF” light in the reeds and rushes of the water.</p>
<p>You do not look where you are going, but where you might go, where you might have been, where you might, in another world, be—a version of yourself whose fingers can thread the arrows, whose hands can grasp the rope, whose legs can leap, whose heart will not feel fear when you discover that you are falling, that there is nothing above or below you, that you will never again see land. You look ahead, to the horizon, where trees and buildings and flowers and farms pop into place while you walk, as if God is behind on his work, struggling to do math in his head, rifling through the papers on the desk for his geometry notes.</p>
<p>You come to a field. A girl stands there, stout and strong, a sling over her shoulder, a tunic as blue, not as this sky, but as the sky you see when you close your eyes.</p>
<p>“Well met, stranger,” the girl says, and you feel as if you know her, but cannot place her face. Someone you lost long ago, someone you’ve been searching for since before you remembered how to breathe.</p>
<p>“Do you know me?” you say, sheathing your sword and holding out your hand, which startles you as it flashes brown and ruddy across your field of vision. It is <em>a </em>hand, but it does not look like yours, how you remember it, how you would draw it for someone if they asked you, if you could remember it, if you could remember anything but the feeling this girl gives you, this ancient stone in your belly weighing you down, making your new life feel so heavy.</p>
<p>“Well met, stranger,” she says. You reach into your bag. You hold out an apple. It is all you can think to give her.</p>
<p>“Well met, stranger.” You reach into your pockets. They are heavy with keys. If only you could find the doors that need opening.</p>
