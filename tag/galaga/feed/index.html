								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We meet at a nearby alternative bookstore, Atomic Books, to play the multicade in their bar (all bookstores should have bars, if you ask me). I’m often in a shirt and tie, coming straight from work. Michael Kimball, my most-regular companion and unofficial instructor, is more comfortably attired in jeans and V-necks. (he also wrote the definitive book on <em>Galaga</em>, titled, appropriately enough, <em><a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/collections/books/products/galaga-by-michael-kimball">Galaga</a></em>) doing his damnedest to teach me the finer points. I listen when he talks about movement and memorization, about how to anticipate the alien spacecrafts&#8217; dives toward my lone fighter. Crucially, he instructs me in the Challenging Stages, harmless levels that break up the deadly action and serve to garner high scores. I try to implement his suggestions. Success is limited.</p>
<p>My first game went surprisingly well, especially considering it had been maybe five years since I&#8217;ve played <em>Galaga</em>. The game was faster than my <em>Galaga</em>-mentor expected; evidently, the system we used using—an emulator “Multicade” with dozens of other classics like 1943, Centipede, and Burger Time, among others—is calibrated at a higher speed than normal. But regardless of the speed, I made it to the tenth or eleventh round and when my final ship burst into pixels, my score sat at 78,000. Just good enough to crack the top five.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty great,&#8221; Kimball said, clapping my shoulder. He&#8217;s a tall man and his hand, heavy and warm, was encouraging. I moved aside as he inserted a new quarter and, with deftness from decades of practice, proceeded to rack up nearly two hundred thousand points, burying me out of the leaderboard and making the top two. He deflected praise and instead pointed at the top name. &#8220;She&#8217;s really good.&#8221; He recognized her from other machines across the city and I realized that Kimball is part of a quiet community.</p>
<p>When I played again, my game nosedived to 60,000. Barely 50,000 after that. Then a game where I lost a life in the first level because of concentration lapse. Finally, by the last game, I&#8217;m under 40,000 and my cool is lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; Kimball said as I, frustrated, allowed pixel-aliens to destroy me without fighting back. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had games like that.&#8221; He played again and then we switch to Phoenix and Burger Time. I enjoyed Burger Time. That shit is weird. Before we left, I played one last game of <em>Galaga</em>, my score unremarkable, but an improvement over the last debacle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1658" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-1.png" alt="retrogamer-galaga-1" width="640" height="410" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-1.png 640w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-1-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><em>Galaga</em> is a simple game: a finite number of enemy ships swoop into the stage from the top and the sides, firing at the player. Among the weak enemy ships, there are “Boss Galaga”: stronger ships that take two hits before exploding. The bosses, in addition to dives, also steal the player’s ship with a tractor beam. Once the ship is captured, it is hidden behind the Boss and the player. By destroying the boss, players can free the ship and use it at the same time for double fighters. “Some people,” Michael said, as he allowed his fighter to be taken, “prefer to only use one. You can play however you like.” I’ve always preferred double-fighters.</p>
<p>When the enemies in each stage are destroyed, the subsequent stage begins. The enemies (they resemble bugs) attach in similar ways, swooping into the screen, but each stage moves incrementally faster, with slightly more enemies that attack a little bit frequently. Every stage is harder than the last. Eventually the enemies flash and swoop across the screen swifter than I can possibly track, their weapons a storm of space-bullets. There are those good enough—either at memorization or their reflexes—to endure past the lightning speed to make it to level 255. I am not one of them.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Kimball and I met several times, taking turns and shooting the shit, in between earnest attempts at my improvement. “Hide in the corners,” he might say in an early stage, “even with, it’s generally safe.” My average scores improve each session. I enjoy myself, of course, but I always come to an enjoyment threshold, beyond which I cannot pass. When our schedules don&#8217;t align, I don&#8217;t manage to make it alone to play. Something always comes up. Much like exercise, it&#8217;s easier on the buddy system.</p>
<hr />
<p>&#8220;Put your fighter here,&#8221; he said, guiding my fighter to a point just to the right of center screen. He&#8217;s soft spoken, but confident. “It’s easier to hit them all on the way down, rather than when they start flying across the screen.” This is not his first rodeo. I follow his directions and press the fire button as fast as I can. I destroy all but one, failing to get the maximum bonus. “You’ll get there.”</p>
<p>He’s right, I knew that. I <em>could </em>get there. But as we continue, I realize there&#8217;s a conundrum that, despite my rising competitive streak and despite my genuine enjoyment, keeps me from going all in. I&#8217;m having fun, but only on the tactile, reflex-level. On a deeper level, I cannot engage with Galaga.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the recent games I&#8217;ve played, such as <em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/03/29/retrogamer-video-game-villains/">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> or the original <em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/04/26/retrogamer-rinse-repeat-reload/">Fallout</a></em>, I&#8217;m never &#8220;there&#8221; with <em>Galaga</em>. There&#8217;s no sinew that connects the game to blood and bone. There&#8217;s no story to immerse in, no characters to empathize with. It&#8217;s just an endless stream of enemies that move faster and faster until I can no longer keep up. What&#8217;s there to connect with? It&#8217;s not <em>Galaga</em>&#8216;s fault, of course. It came out in 1981, a sequel to <em>Galaxian</em>. Games were primitive back then, and had little space for commodities like story. Kimball has been playing since <em>Galaxian</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m sure other players have engaged with <em>Galaga</em>. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve written fan fiction or have imagined themselves in the role of the starfighter (a la The Last Starfighter) Perhaps someone has sexualized the Boss Fighters that tractor beam the player ships and hide them behind enemy lines—in fact, according to the rule 34 of the internet, &#8220;If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will not google <em>Galaga</em>-porn.</p>
<p>Instead of the truly immersive experience that games have aspired to for the past few decades, <em>Galaga</em> is really just a game, no different than any other that rewards dexterity and reflexes. It&#8217;s like pickup basketball, in a way. I surely enjoy being on the blacktop and working up a sweat, but I don&#8217;t dream about it when I&#8217;m not there.</p>
<p>Playing with Kimball and others who dropped in over the past few months illustrated a happening that I&#8217;ve encountered more and more often the older I&#8217;ve gotten. Kimball is a master at <em>Galaga</em>; he&#8217;s been playing since the early 80s and grew up with it. “The first time the spaceships attacked from the bottom was a shock,” he said. “We’d never seen anything like it before.” I understood what he meant; I remembered the first time I played <em>FF3 </em>and the bad guy blew up the world. That was some shit.</p>
<p>I played <em>Galaga</em> here and there over the decades and have a general level of facility with video games—I&#8217;m not bad by any means, but I&#8217;m no pro. The others that drop in? There were tens of thousands of points between Kimball and myself and more tens of thousands between me and the rest. It&#8217;s disparity.</p>
<p>I run into this same problem whenever I play chess or get into a swimming pool. I&#8217;ve been playing chess since 1985. I started swimming competitively in 1990. I&#8217;m better than the vast majority of the population. It&#8217;s just the way it is. I&#8217;m no savant, but I have a certain advantage.</p>
<p>Of course, I never progressed past &#8220;being just good.&#8221; I found other interests, I realized the height of my natural gifts, I started smoking pot; there are a thousand reasons. But with activities like chess and swimming, it&#8217;s hard to find a fair match. Either I&#8217;m much better or I&#8217;m much worse. The sweet spot of &#8220;good, not great&#8221; is weirdly hard to find.</p>
<p>Competition, after a certain point, is hard to match up. And sans competition, enthusiasm only goes so far. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s plenty of folks who want to complete level 255 and crash the system, but I&#8217;m not one of them. Nor do I think that my reflexes can be honed to that point. No, for me, the point of the game is to beat the high score that&#8217;s on the multicade. If I can&#8217;t do that, I just want to beat my own high score.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1659" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-2.png" alt="retrogamer-galaga-2" width="600" height="422" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-2.png 600w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-2-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>In so many games, this is all I aspire to: beat myself and the next best person. Kimball is not the next best person in <em>Galaga</em>; he&#8217;s too many rungs up. I&#8217;m not sure where that person is. Maybe there is no such person. I know I never found that person playing <em>Minesweeper</em>.</p>
<p>From 2002 until whenever it stopped coming equipped on all PCs, I turned on Minesweeper and ran the table when I encountered a new computer—parents&#8217;, girlfriends&#8217;, bosses&#8217;. I did this for years, for the express purpose of owning the leaderboard. There was no real point to this besides my need to be the best. I was good enough to win the beginning level in under ten seconds, the intermediate level in under a minute and the expert level in something like five.</p>
<p>These are probably not particularly impressive numbers in the larger scheme of things, but I&#8217;m not concerned about the national stage. I&#8217;m concerned with my own loci of operation. The point is that there was no machine I touched that I didn&#8217;t have the high score. I never found anyone even close.</p>
<p>Most people are not going to ever flirt with perfection or become a master at anything. We&#8217;re told we can, of course, because that&#8217;s the American Dream: anyone can become president or win the Olympic gold or become <em>America&#8217;s Next Top Plastic Surgeon</em> (if that&#8217;s not a reality show already&#8230; dibs). But it&#8217;s a damned lie. The combination of factors needed to master a skill is a lottery win: a body needs time, support, commercial benefit (or at least a trust fund), a deep-rooted drive to compete and, of course, oodles of natural talent. Any schmuck can spend ten thousand hours nocking a bow and hitting a target, and they&#8217;ll get good, but only a few special schmucks are capable of being the best around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m good at a lot of things: chess, swimming, darts, bowling, writing, poker, video games, public speaking, performance, even dance and cooking. I&#8217;ve spent hundreds of hours on each and I have talent. But there comes a time where my skill hits that threshold that will require a dedication I simply don&#8217;t possess in order to surpass it. Nor do I want to possess it. I&#8217;ll never be able to commit the time and study to up my chess game and it was in high school that I realized I&#8217;d never be anything beyond a second string swimmer. My floor was fairly high, but I could see my <em>Galaga </em>ceiling right away. Maybe I could master it eventually, but without a competitor, one close to my own ability, I couldn&#8217;t take it there myself.</p>
<p>The best races I ever swam were against swimmers within milliseconds of my time, my best chess matches against those just better or just worse than I. Only against equals or near-equals can we really engage.</p>
<p><em>Galaga</em> was created at a different time in the world, when arcades were filled with youth boasting, flirting, wiling away their hours in pursuit of an electronic ideal. I experienced the tail end of the arcade world with <em>Street Fighter 2</em>. But I liked the vibe that I found, even if I was too young to engage in the subculture beyond incidental words of encouragement tossed my way.</p>
<p>Being tremendous at a game in those days meant bragging rights, meant others vicariously enjoying victories and quietly (or not so quietly) cursing when their own records were broken. There was an implicit community, spurring players on to greater heights. I experienced it only briefly before the death of arcades, hovering around and learning from the big kids. In the back of those arcades, of course, were games like <em>Galaga</em>, not neglected, exactly, but lacking in former glory. Records would stay on those leaderboards for summers, years.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1660" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-3.png" alt="retrogamer-galaga-3" width="500" height="312" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-3.png 500w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/retrogamer-galaga-3-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Which brings me back to now. While I&#8217;d played <em>Galaga</em> a handful of times over the years, mostly in dirt-bars while drunk, I wasn&#8217;t particularly good. But I always wanted to be good; I wanted to make a quarter last more than a bare handful of minutes. Being skilled at anything is a reward in and of itself. And every time I saw <em>Galaga</em> in the haunts that I frequent, I&#8217;d get the itch to play. I’d want to prove something to myself. When Kimball and I met the first time, I wanted to be good. When we met the last time (for now), I feel like maybe, I&#8217;m not that bad.</p>
<p>On the last day, I get to Atomic Books a few minutes before Kimball and began <em>Galaga</em>. Warm from the weather, my limbs were loose. My finger found a beautiful pattern on the joystick, the ship firing <em>pew pew, pew pew</em>. Challenging Stages offered little resistance—I exploded all comers, leaving behind bonus points. My double fighters were an unstoppable wave of death. After the tenth level, my first fighter was destroyed. I advanced farther than I ever have before.</p>
<p>Kimball joined me just as I cracked 100,000. He clapped my back and I twitched, but not enough for my concentration to falter. I played a few more minutes until the speed became too much for me and I died in a burst of brilliance. I grinned. &#8220;That was fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t play much more <em>Galaga</em> after that, concentrating instead on the other games in the multicade. We haven’t been back since, what with summer and weddings and travel. That&#8217;s fine with me: I still see my name on the leaderboard. It&#8217;s not highly ranked—not close to the top two—but I&#8217;m happy, even for the short amount of time it will rest there. My personal threshold, my pinnacle of <em>Galaga </em>prowess, maybe it hasn’t been reached. I like that. I like that there’s still room for growth. It’s not like I’ll never play <em>Galaga</em> again. Just the other day, I was in an arcade and saw an old machine. I wanted to see if I could crack the leaderboard—maybe next time I see it, I will.</p>
<p>I’ll never be dominant in <em>Galaga</em>, but I don’t need to be. I just need to be good enough.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Kimball, who authored the book <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/collections/books/products/galaga-by-michael-kimball" target="_blank"><em>Galaga</em></a> for <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/" target="_blank">Boss Fight Books</a>, recently interviewed a backer to the press&#8217; first Kickstarter &#8220;season,&#8221; which was 900% funded last year. Gabe Durham, the man behind Boss Fight Books, was kind enough to let us publish the interview here.</p>
<p>The second season of Boss Fight Books is currently underway—<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gabedurham/boss-fight-books-season-2" target="_blank">be sure to donate</a> to get your hands on some fantastic video game writing.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Michael Kimball:</strong> I know nothing about you except that you like video games, so what was the first video game you loved and why?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Tarantino:</strong> The first video game I loved? Love is a strong emotion so I have to believe it&#8217;s the one that left the most permanent impression. First, some background. I was the progeny of my father&#8217;s second marriage and my brother lived up on Long Island, NY. I would only see him when he came down during the summer and I was at my dad&#8217;s house (my parents split up before I was in 1st grade and I went to live with my mom). So, during those rare instances of time actually together, we played the NES at my dad&#8217;s house. One of the only co-op games we had was <em>Bubble Bobble</em>. You played these adorable little dragons that could shoot bubbles, and they could also hop on bubbles and capture enemies with their bubbles. A lot of pastels and cutesy imagery, but the game was hard to us as kids. I remember we&#8217;d always try and try to beat the game (level 99, I believe) until one day we actually succeeded. I think my brother found some bypass scenario akin to Mario Bros. games. But the result was still sweet: we beat the final boss and were ecstatic. We never could beat the game again no matter how hard we tried. However, we loved playing that game together, something our separate lives (Pennsylvania and NY) could never come close to.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> Part of what made <em>Galaga</em> an important game to me was playing with my friend Todd. And my girlfriend Molly and I play this stupid-yet-beautiful game called <em>Bust-a-Move</em> that probably wouldn’t be that much fun playing with anybody else. What other games did you and your brother especially like playing together? And/or, are there any other games that were special because of the person with whom you played that game?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino:</strong> Because of my older brother living in NY and me living in PA with my mother, we didn&#8217;t really get to see each other a lot. I can remember playing college football games on the Genesis when I was in middle school and my brother was in high school during some summers, but nothing like a bonding experience we had previously. He was more into summer flings and I was, well, more of a nerd. I didn&#8217;t really play games with other people until I got my own Xbox (original) and went to college. I remember playing <em>Halo </em>with some of the guys on my floor my freshmen year, but I was far and away the most prolific of gamers. My sophomore year I made friends with two guys and one of them, Steve Watts, was <em>really</em> into gaming. So much so that now he&#8217;s the Editor-in-Chief for Shacknews.com. Steve helped with being okay with my nerdy gaming side. We&#8217;d play (mostly his games) <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>., etc. You know, the staples of college life in the early 2000s. After college, when I made a fateful decision to buy an Xbox 360 without my wife&#8217;s consent (did not repeat this mistake with the Xbox One), I slowly found a group of gamers online through the classic (and un-molested) beauty <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em>. A group of us met regularly online to play the Multiplayer as well as on the Activision (maybe Treyarch/Infinity Ward?) forums for W@W until we all decided to end our association with the repressive moderation of said forums through a mass banning. From that we started our own forum site at <a href="http://4rumboys.com">4rumboys.com</a> and have stuck together now after almost 5 years. I haven&#8217;t met any of them in person, but we regularly keep informed of everything going on through our website and through Facebook. Now, I am normally one to focus on single-player games, being a father of two young children, but it&#8217;s good to get online and talk to friends who are as dedicated (and sometimes obsessed) as you are about gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> So what happened when you bought the Xbox 360 without your wife’s consent?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino:</strong> I bought it at discount when Circuit City was going out of business. One of those, I&#8217;m going out to get this one thing from Circuit City because they have a big sale; which turns into me coming home with the XBox 360 as well. I can&#8217;t remember what else I bought. Naturally it was a fight about money and responsibility. No amount of pleading on my side about the phenomenal deal I got would soothe it over.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball: </strong>Why do you think you are so obsessed with gaming? Or would you use a different term to describe your relation to gaming?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino: </strong>I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m obsessed with gaming. I&#8217;m very passionate about it. I thoroughly enjoy my time playing video games, but I know I have other responsibilities and I also have other passions in life. I know that I&#8217;ve molded myself into a person that other people want to talk to—and that means staying away from talking about video games with my peers (30+ professional crowd). The other hard part of not being obsessed is because I know my wife doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get it,&#8221; as we have talked about many times. Sure, she could play hours (and does) of <em>Freefall</em> or <em>Angry Birds</em>, but as soon as I pick up the XBox controller when our children are asleep—it verges on an argument. I have told her on multiple occasions that I like to decompress by playing video games because I don&#8217;t have to worry about anything. I also don&#8217;t spend hours in front of the TV playing video games when I know I have other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Enough of the rant about my non-obsession. Why am I passionate about video games? I have grown up with video games. When my parents divorced and I lived with my father until 4th grade, video games were there to distract me while he worked on starting his own business. When I went to live with my mother and my older sister, video games were there to distract me while my mother worked all day. I found the worlds of video games fascinating, an escape from my situation, much akin to what you described in your book. I think my wife is afraid because of the horror stories of video game addicts. However, I&#8217;ve done this for most of my life and I know how to put down the controller. The video games have matured and grown in terms of depth so much that it is quite amazing. I remember finishing the original <em>Halo Triology</em>. Epic story with a good finish. I never got around to finishing <em>Halo 4</em>, but still: a good story. Then you have franchises like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>, which have blown open the doors on how deep a video game universe can be (yes, yes, and <em>World of Warcraft</em>). You have these pieces of interactive digital art and storytelling that allows users to go beyond their simple lives and do great things. I love that. I love that I can look at a distinct twist in the history of the world (the <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> franchise) and take part in that history. The story is amazing and the gameplay, with the advent of next gen consoles, continues to improve drastically. Look at the recent critically acclaimed IP of <em>Destiny</em>. I picked up a copy because the story was supposed to be good. While the story, as people found out, isn&#8217;t all that deep on the ground surface (good guys fight universal evil), you come to understand there is something deeper. Why is the Darkness coming after us? What is the Darkness? Are we really the threat to the universe? It&#8217;s fascinating. Obssessed? No. Passionate and dedicated.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> How would you describe the “it” that your wife does not get?</p>
<p><strong>Taratino: </strong>I&#8217;ve wondered about this a lot since getting married. Funny how some things you never talk about during dating and courtship turn into issues when you become married. On the surface, I believe my wife thinks playing video games is both childish and shirking responsibilities. Yet I believe it&#8217;s also rooted in my wife feeling that we don&#8217;t spend enough time together. There may be truths in both. Simply, she didn&#8217;t grow up with the same life situations that I did. I come from a broken home and was torn from my dad&#8217;s custody before 4th grade to live with my mom. As I said before, video games were an escape from my predicament for me. I never made, nor make, lasting friendships (except with my wife) because then you can&#8217;t be hurt. (Such a good movie premise, I know.) Video games were there to take me away from it all. My wife grew up with a conservative mother and father who didn&#8217;t even let her have sugary cereal until she was in high school. She was more sheltered and encouraged to pursue activities such as piano, track and field, and soccer. While we&#8217;re both introverts, my wife and I cope with it differently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought a lot about the gaming culture and I have to say it&#8217;s a balancing act between true obsession/addiction on one side and a normal habit on the other. See, habit, it&#8217;s the first word I thought of. You wrote about driving the Ohio Turnpike and getting that &#8220;itch&#8221; to play every <em>Galaga</em> machine you and your girlfriend could find until you realized what was happening. Is that an addiction? Or is it okay to indulge yourself to that extent? Remember, it&#8217;s not like I sit at home all day neglecting my children, my family, or my career to play video games &#8212; that&#8217;s addiction. I do play to relieve my stress (and add new fictitious stress) at the end of the day. It&#8217;s mind-numbing and I believe that&#8217;s another reason my wife doesn&#8217;t like it. Maybe she sees it as the slide into total addiction.</p>
<p>So, in short, it&#8217;s a combination of all facets of what&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; about video games. Whenever I ask my wife why it upsets her, it&#8217;s the same: waste of time; waste of energy; and it&#8217;s childish. It&#8217;s something that her and I can&#8217;t relate to with each other and maybe on some level that upsets her.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> I’m glad that Molly likes to play games as much as I do. Having that play in my life makes me a happier person and gives me a sense of satisfaction that I often find difficult to explain. I’m circling back to something you said in your first answer: What makes winning a boss fight so satisfying?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino:</strong> Boss fights are the culmination of everything you have worked towards in the game. Or should be. There can be really great boss fights: I think of the first two <em>Mass Effect</em> games. The third installment had the finality everyone wanted, but the boss fight was more of a bother than an actual ending. There are really bad boss fights, my personal example being the <em>Deus Ex:</em> <em>Human Evolution</em> final fight. So you go around beating this group of rogue cybernetic humans as bosses throughout the game and the final one has this insanely powerful shotgun. I think I replayed the fight, since I kept dying, seven or eight times before I finally just looked up the ending on the internet and called it quits. Some people may say that&#8217;s a quitter’s mentality, but maybe I want my leveling up to mean something. Boss fights should be challenging, yes, but should not be something that is baiting you for a &#8220;rage-quit&#8221; or for the abject disappointment of having to remember an intricate pattern. Boss fights, in my opinion, should be a challenging reward, not so tough and complicated you need to do everything perfectly correct in order to win.</p>
