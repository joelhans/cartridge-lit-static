				<description><![CDATA[<p>Fallout 2 might be my favorite game of all time. It doesn’t have the same nostalgia factor that earlier games like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger have, and it will never match the replay factor of the Ogre Battle series. It’s not as mind-numbing as Ken Griffey Jr. or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and it doesn’t have the camaraderie associations that Tekken 3 has. But what it does have is this: perfection.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is hard. Some folks fall in and out of love easily. Some take a little longer. I’m the longer and I don’t always maintain the love. I’m quite fond of quite a bit, but love? I love my wife (hi Leigh!), I love my family, I love my cats. I love a few friends. But otherwise? I love Thai Drunken Noodles and there’s this vegetarian buffalo “chicken” place in Portland that I dream about. And when it comes to pop culture? The love comes hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t fallen “in love” with too much pop culture. Sure, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">like</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all kinds of culture because culture, if it’s anything, is what individuals </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are social herd animals, made to disseminate information and to share thoughts and feelings. Culture is the communion of one person and another person and their friends and their family until tendrils spread Cthulhu-like. Culture is cool, ever since that first caveman was like, “yo, look at these dope paintings” and another caveman was like, “meh. I’ve seen better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Dokken; from amusement parks and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everybody Hates Chris</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Thelonious Monk and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">X-Men</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I like a ton. But love? Love, again, is hard. I haven’t found too much to love. I love reading, I love swimming, and I love video games. Sometimes, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t remember not playing video games. I had an older brother and he had an Atari. I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventure</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space Invaders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frogger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My favorite was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asteroids</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I wouldn’t say I loved it. I thought it was cool, but I also liked the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soul Train/Brady Bunch </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">block on Nickelodeon. I liked playing with Legos and Tonka trucks. I was a child and to a child, the world is infinite. But while I liked video games and television, reading was really my jam. I read constantly, from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berenstain Bears</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Cauldron</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hobbit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Video games were a distant third, behind reading and running around outside. Maybe even fourth, if you count the aforementioned </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soul Train/Brady Bunch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when my brother leveled up and got a Nintendo, it wasn’t yet the come-to-Jesus moment. I didn’t thirst to play video games. Sure, I rocked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and all the other shitty and/or super difficult games on the Nintendo that I scarcely remember: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legendary Wings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid Icarus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goonies II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They were great or they were terrible and when it was time to go outside and have acorn wars, well, that was fine. I even broke off gaming for homework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t until 1990 that I fell in love. Or became obsessed (depends upon your definition, I suppose). I’d always been into fantasy and sci-fi, ever since my dad played me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when I was too young to remember, and time strengthened that bond. I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicles of Narnia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicles of Prydain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I was a tween. I knew more about Loki and Anansi than was healthy for any red-blooded American boy who didn’t want his ass kicked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fated, perhaps, that I would find </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Note: this essay is not about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m getting there. I might be burying the lede, but there’s a reason for everything. Trust the process, nameless reader. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FF</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was everything I didn’t know I wanted. It allowed me everything I didn’t have. I could be strong and wise, explore brave new worlds, seek out new life…and kill it. I could save princesses and grow into a stronger, better version of me. I’d find dragons and elves and whilst interacting with them, be a hero. Save the day. God knows I didn’t have much of that in my day-to-day life. I was a kid, with a high-need older brother and busy, overworked parents. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was my first video game love and one of my first pop culture loves, joining with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as one of the sacrosanct. Eventually others would join: I’d discover Nirvana in junior high, weed (and weed culture) in high school, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in college. But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from it, Role Playing Games in general, became my raison d’être. I couldn’t get enough of that shit. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrono Trigger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breath of Fire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragon Warrior</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy IV</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">VI</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paladin’s Quest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret of Mana</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Link to the Past</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Mario RPG</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogre Battle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I played them all and I played the ever loving bejeebus out of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I played the next generation of RPGs: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suikoden </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&amp; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suikoden II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vandal Hearts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tactics Ogre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogre Battle 64</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagea, Knights of the Old Republic, Fable, Jade Empire, Dragon Force, Chrono Cross, Grandia I &amp; II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I played every role playing game I could get my hand on and I loved them. Maybe not equally, but enough. There was something about them that never stopped pressing my endorphin buttons. I could sit and stare and play all day, all night. Sure, I stopped when my friends called or my girlfriends wanted to hang out or if I had a really good book (actually, books usually won). But I skipped life to role play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were reasons for all of that, of course, reasons I’m just now digging into. I’ve recently been diagnosed with Bipolar II (I have highs and lows, but my highs aren’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high and are outnumbered by the lows) and after many talks with shrinks, I’m coming to understand that the excessive video gaming bouts were numbing behaviors. It’s the same reason I smoked myself into oblivion for the better part of a decade. Sure I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loved </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">weed and RPGs, but I didn’t love them that much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my early 20s, I stepped away from video games for a few years of travel and volunteer work and discovered a taste for a lot more than I’d known. Travel, cooking, writing, working out, dancing. I was becoming a more whole person, learning and enjoying myself more. But that didn’t mean I didn’t like video games all of a sudden. It just meant my drive had dwindled and my focus was diluted, spread as it was into other, arguably healthier pursuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, my brother gave me his PS3. I didn’t particularly want it, but it was a nice gesture. And it tapped into a mild hankering for gaming that I hadn’t known was there. I hadn’t played much in years: none of my old games were doing it for me and I didn’t know how to find new ones. It was like when I stopped smoking weed regularly and wanted to get back into it. You can’t just saunter into high schools and start asking to buy some pot. That kind of tomfoolery ends poorly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took the PS3 and left it in my basement for six months before I touched it. Then, around Christmas time, Leigh asked me what I wanted so she could tell her parents. I did 5 minutes of Google searching and found this game called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a bunch of top-ten lists. I remembered vaguely hearing about it when it was all the rage. Lo and behold, on Christmas, my brother-in-law gifted me with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t need to go over the specifics of what happened when I touched </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/05/26/retrogamer-the-ruins-of-old-olney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first essay I wrote for <em>Cartridge Lit</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goes over that in quite some detail. But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FO3 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparked a resurgence in my video gaming, helped clarify what I was looking for. I wanted something different, wanted to challenge myself. And it worked. I discovered a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*No, this essay isn’t about that, either, but we are getting closer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2264" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="370" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1.jpg 500w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FO3, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved on a few months later to <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/11/10/retrogamer-the-tragedy-of-chocolate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one half a year after that, with <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/04/26/retrogamer-rinse-repeat-reload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fallout</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve talked about those a lot, but I haven’t really discussed the overarching “something” that twinged and came into focus with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> universe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t help who you love. This cliché is usually used to absolve someone of remarkably poor choices in romantic partners. There’s a connection that occurs between people, chemical reactions and that, binding people together, sometimes inextricably. There is no conscious reason for it, no other logic beyond “this works.” Maybe it’s olfactory, maybe it’s destiny. Who knows? Smarter people than me are still stuck on the problem of love. “Shit happens” sums it up nicely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same can be said for pop culture. Why do people fall in love with what they do? Maybe there’s a subconscious switch. Maybe there’s a Freudian connection with oral/anal phases of development. I don’t know why I love the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> franchise so much. It’s dark and nihilistic, rife with gallows humor and intense hyper-violence. It’s glitchy and broken and there are so many dark places within. And still, for some reason, god I love it. Especially, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It builds upon its predecessor: more options, more companions, more viable builds, more locations, more factions, more accessories, more cars (just the one, but still). And it’s the first that expands the history and lore behind the world it inhabits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that fleshes out the super mutants and the ghouls, that begins to talk in more detail about vaults and Vault Tec. It’s the first that gets into nitty gritty world-building, what with left-behind AI, a plethora of data discs to read, countless NPCs to mine for information. It keeps the freedom of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kill who you want, break quests, who gives a shit?—but adds context and texture. It doesn’t necessarily answer a lot of questions or connect dots (it remains to be seen if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3, NV </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">4’s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">attention to detail in that regard is for the good or bad), but it sketches a world that is rich, vibrant, and with the illusion of life. A simulacrum of living. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be my favorite game of all time. It doesn’t have the same nostalgia factor that earlier games like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrono Trigger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have, and it will never match the replay factor of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogre Battle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series. It’s not as mind-numbing as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Griffey Jr.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it doesn’t have the camaraderie associations that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tekken 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has. But what it does have is this: perfection. It’s as perfect a game as I’ve ever played. And it’s so, so rich in the one thing I love more than anything else. Story. A world. Lore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never not been interested in lore, in asking questions and learning answers. It’s why I fell in love with role playing genres to begin with. It’s why I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic: the Gathering</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and created histories for my invented characters in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s why I began writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started writing in high school and pursued it in college. But I wasn’t driven and, more importantly, I didn’t have much to say. I wrote a few short stories and a play, and they were well received (I suppose) by my college lit mag. But everything else I wrote just seemed to be pastiche, a derivation of a derivation of a carbon copy. After graduation, I made a conscious choice to put away my writing until I knew my asshole from my elbow enough to tell stories with conviction and originality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put away writing for a decade. And it stayed away. But then I wrote a short story because I had an image of a snowfall, and then I took a creative writing class on a lark when I got my second undergraduate degree. And I met a professor who inspired me, whose life I envied because he could talk about books and writing all day. So I applied to grad school for writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I wondered: what do I write about? That question plagued me</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, I went to a reading of a local Baltimore writer for his book on <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/galaga-by-michael-kimball" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Galaga</em></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I was like, “Holy shit, people can write about video games?” And I realized that, yes, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> write about it. And if other people can, then I too could write about anything I want. If Michael Kimball can write about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galaga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then maybe I can write about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or eventually, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/07/28/retrogamer-threshold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Galaga</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Not long after, I came upon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s submission call and I thought, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just want to play old games and make up for lost time. Maybe they’ll publish me if I write about my experiences*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thanks, Justin Daugherty and Joel Hans!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some time, I thought I was conning everyone. Here I get to do something I want to anyway, and get published for it. Have people read my words and, whether or not they like them, at least take the time to appreciate my spin. A couple of times a year, I DJ at a local club in Baltimore. I play music and people dance and I get paid for it and I think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shit. I’d do this for free.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve thought the same of Retrogamer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I mean, technically, I’ve written these essays for free, but I now have a body of work. I have 60,000 words on video games, enough to compile into a book. I’ve made contacts with writers throughout the country. Again, all for something I do for fun.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a heckuva journey. I’ve played more video games in the past two years than at any other moment of my life. I might be a grown ass man, but I’m good at time management and I know how to take care of responsibilities so I can play guilt-free. I’ve played more games than I’ve had space to write about, all the while saying “I’m working.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the pinnacle. How often does one come across “love” in their life? Yeah, falling in love with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is weird, y’all. But it’s a game that fits my humor, my style; it ticks every box I have. What can I even say about it when I want to say everything? Instead of saying everything, I’ll say this: I loved it, but it also brought a certain reality to light.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2265" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="320" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2.jpg 320w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing about video games isn’t forever. I’m kind of tapped out. I have other projects, other commitments. I’m mostly finished with a novel. I’m putting together writing retreats and panel discussions. I run an indie press that’s taking on more and more authors. This writing thing is becoming a career, a passion and a vocation and all that junk all wrapped up in one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video games need to become a hobby again. A hobby I really, really enjoy, but a hobby nonetheless. Retrogamer has never really been about the video game, and this essay is not really about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (though I recommend everyone play it who hasn’t already). It’s always been mostly about me, about my own journey, through a particular lens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’ve run out of things to say about me. So instead of forcing it, I’m just going to step away from Retrogamer, like a Lone Wanderer or a Vault Dweller. Not the Chosen One, cause that sounds super-duper pretentious and self-involved (though that’s the name of the hero in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would have had some nice circle-coming-back, but oh well), so maybe the Courier? Yeah, I like that. I’m the Courier, stepping away to take messages to other places*.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Let’s run with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, for now, I’m gonna say goodbye. Thanks to all those who read, and to the editors at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for letting me ramble about the <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/08/25/arson-battlecats-majestic-sweater-vest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/12/27/retrogamer-speed-dating-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ex-girlfriends</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and how, holy shit do I not give a crap about<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/06/30/retrogamer-an-objective-reality-and-a-croconaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pokémon</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(#hottake). I dislike Pokémon as much as I love Fallout, and now I know it. I can appreciate it all a little better from outside. Because I’ve had a chance to live in the world of gaming and get caught up on so much that I missed: of video games and of writing and what’s in between. I’m happy about that. And I’m ready to move on.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every morning, but often enough, I wake up at 6 am to run. Often I run with a friend, Luke, but just as often I run by myself. There’s comfort in making my body move, in tracking accomplishments in minutes, miles, and sweat. When Luke and I run around the neighborhood, we chat. Or he chats and I huff and puff and throw words in his direction. He’s in better shape than I, so words come easier to him. But I’m getting there. We talk about writing, as he’s a English professor at a nearby university and a fellow writer of fiction. We talk shop, but also sports and the harmony between fitness and writing, fitness and anything really. Many of our writing peers don’t see the utility in “activity” or what the point in sports is. I get where they’re coming from. But as anyone who’s read this column knows, I have a </span><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/08/25/arson-battlecats-majestic-sweater-vest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">streak of interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in sports and </span><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/03/21/retrogamer-welcome-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it bleeds into</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the gaming.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to running, I work out. In my basement: free weights, an exercise bike, a heavy bag, a yoga mat, an elliptical. I own baseballs and baseball mitts, soccer balls and hacky sacks. My in-laws bought me a tennis racket but I can’t really swing since my shoulders are (still) jacked up from collegiate swimming. I don’t often get in the pool these days, but another writer-athlete and I got wet only last week to read poetry and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/110303976265318/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%222%22%2C%22ref_dashboard_filter%22%3A%22past%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then race for charity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She smoked my ass, since this particular poet raced for Rutgers University, a Division 1 school, and is also in crazy ridiculous shape. But winning was never the point. Moving was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemingway might have said, “Only pussies sit at their desk all day.” He didn’t but he might have because he was not PC and that’s a super non-PC way to convey a certain sentiment. What’s the point of living if you’re not living and living actively? At least five days a week, I try to do </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">something</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whether it’s a long walk or a game of kickball or dancing. If I don’t move, my body feels coated in sludge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a problem, because many of my interests are sedentary. Writing. Chess. Movies. Reading. Video games. Especially video games. But we’ll get back to that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news about  staying active is that, in addition to the physical benefits (incidentally, I’ve lost 35 lbs in the last 4 months), it’s also </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">social</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I have my aforementioned  running buddy and friends who come over and lift with me; Leigh does yoga alongside me; I have dance partners to swing dance with or go to 80s nights at shitty coke bars in the heart of Baltimore; a friend and I have bi-monthly pickup kickball games. And of course, I have people to play softball (never baseball these days) or soccer or sometimes touch football. Hours of activity with fellow 30-somethings and then we often retire to a bar or restaurant, sometimes to a friend’s porch for day drinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s community. It’s communion. There’s not much else like sitting around in an afterglow of muscle burn, the endorphins shooting through veins like electric butter, bullshitting with friends about whatever the hell we’re talking about. The content doesn’t matter. It’s the context. It’s a connection I’ve always been into, since Little League and my early swimming days. For a weird, introverted nerd like me, being able to smash a home run or eke out a win in the 200 free, well, it’s a way I’ve been able to sneak into another world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, being able to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">play</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sports doesn’t necessarily translate to navigating daily life. Because outside of athletes, bench presses and racing starts don’t get one far in conversation. And if there’s one thing I’m still bad at, probably always will be, it’s meaningless chit chat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, I find it challenging: working in an office, talking to a friend’s spouse, even being out and about, you run into these situations all the time. And how do I relate to a person I have nothing to talk about with? Most times, we can retreat to sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But not the act of playing sports. I live in Baltimore with the Orioles and the Ravens. I’m close to DC and Philly and New York, with a dozen other professional teams, maybe more. And if there’s one thing people around here like, it&#8217;s talking about their team doing this and that and the other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the problem, again, is that I don’t care about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other people </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sports. To paraphrase pop culture writer Chuck Klosterman about his dichotomous feelings for the Boston Celtics as a child and as an adult, “The coaches are different, the players are different, the colors are different. The only thing the same is the flooring. I’m not rooting for flooring.” Yeah, I abstractly like the Orioles, but I know the players don’t care about me, the owners are in it for money, it’s all ra-ra nonsense. And talking about football is even more problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional sports culture is kind of wack. Many professional athletes seem like one-dimensional creatures who ball so hard, but fail at the rest of life. Sure, there are exceptions like </span><a href="https://math.mit.edu/~urschel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this dude</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is a genius or like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_career_of_Arnold_Schwarzenegger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this dude</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who understands business and politics and being a movie star, but mastering a sport </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">requires</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the forfeiture of being well-rounded. Exceptions stick out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the correlation of athletes to sociopathy, well. When winning is the only thing that matters, allowances are made for lapses in character. And even when they’re not bad people out raping and murdering and upper-cutting their wives, hyper-competitiveness comes out in weird ways, like Michael Jordan’s alleged</span><a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060614" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gambling problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And MJ seems like an OK dude. Let’s not chat about </span><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/ct-pete-rose-sex-allegation-20170731-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete Rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, eh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, athletes are weird people to root for. And besides them, there’s an industry set up to exploit them. The NFL has known about the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (aka: how multiple concussions is awful) for a long time and has resisted efforts to minimize damage to players until only recently. And the efforts of universities to make millions off of college athletes while keeping them indentured servants, i.e. making it “illegal” for them to make money. There are many examples, but to keep it simple: the sports are weird, the players are weird. It’s all strange. So yeah, I like to play sports, but watching it? Caring about individuals who comprise a team? I don’t know about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That cognitive dissonance between liking sports and talking about collegiate/professional sports creates a barrier for me. And even though talking about sports would create an easy passage to chit-chat, how could I get over the hump? The answer proved to be video games: fantasy sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I couldn’t actually get into the players or the idea of liking sports, I snuck into the back door of it: fantasy sports, years and years after the rest of the world started playing. The first fantasy baseball team started around </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_baseball" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1980</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I knew people in college playing fantasy basketball. Leigh’s fantasy football team, the Illegal Eagles, won her family’s league in 1994. It’s been </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">around</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this video game for people who don’t play video games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, in 2013, despite my reservations, I decided it was time for me to give it a shot. Better late to this party than never, I suppose. I came to the party, not because I was super into the idea of playing a fantasy game, but because I wanted a shortcut to everyday office chit chat. I wanted to be able to connect with people I don’t know how to connect with. And I like video games and stats. It seemed like a win-win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, it was a win-win. I started a football league and recruited a few colleagues, most of whom had never played fantasy. And we all got into it, started talking about our favorite players, teams we discovered that we liked, even the numbers game. And for me, I started envisioning my fantasy team in RPG terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See, in fantasy sports (let’s just focus on football), one has to recruit a bunch of players. The running back (RB) is handed the football and then, you know, runs with it. A fantasy team needs two of these. The wide receiver (WR) catches the football from far out; a fantasy team also needs two of those. The tight end (TE) is kind of like a wide receiver in that they also catch the ball and go with it, but they’re bigger and slower and are also used defensively (though that doesn’t play into the fantasy aspect), consequently they receive less points than the WR and most leagues only require one. Only one kicker (K) and defense (D) are required and they don’t have clever names: they do just what they say, kick the ball and defend against it, respectively. Finally, the quarterback (QB) leads the team and gets all the points. Only one required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team, once recruited, looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2235" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug2.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="440" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug2.jpg 585w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug2-300x226.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To bring it home, an RPG party, once recruited, might look something like this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2236" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug3-576x1024.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug3-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug3-169x300.jpg 169w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug3-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug3.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2237" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug4.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug4.jpg 512w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Aug4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the metaphor breaks down the deeper one digs. But to me, the connection is clear. The focus on stats, the recruitment of characters and management, playing the rock-paper-scissors game (Tifa is a physical fighter and effective against mages; Colin Kaepernick is a mobile quarterback and the Rams are weak against running quarterbacks). It’s all interconnected and one skill informs the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m good at looking at lists of available players in the “free agent” pool (those are characters anyone can recruit, they’re often generic) and identifying ones with outlying stats. Making sure all my slots are full or, if needed empty, comes easy to me, considering I’ve spent countless hours playing strategy games and doing the same thing. Marrying strategy and stats with video games: the obviously natural progression in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a child and teenager and college student, I split my time evenly between introverted activities and sports. The sports kids never understood what the hell I talked about half the time, but they accepted my minimal talents. And conversely, my nerd-friends with whom I did theater, played Magic the Gathering, and video-gamed out couldn’t grasp why I would want to run around with jocks and get sweaty and nasty. The two worlds never converged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantasy sports are many things&#8211;lame, nerdy, pointless maybe, culturally problematic certainly&#8211;but they also marry two obsessions of mine, and I took to it with more gusto than I expected. I wound up winning my first league and starting another. Now I run a friends-league that’s been going on for a couple years now. And I recently launched a friends-league for baseball. I’m in the midst of the season now and while it hasn’t dug into my need for physical activity, it has cut into my video game time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, I’m playing already one daily video game (162 games in baseball, kids). It’s okay that I don’t have enough room for more. I’m playing with friends and family, I’m able to talk knowledgeably about teams in other cities and states to whomever I need to. The experiment worked, even if the experiment makes me feel a little icky when I think about the larger picture.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And watching my team of baseballers compete and perform excellence on the field has reawakened my own desire to be physically active. Working out daily, running, came </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fantasy sports, not before. It’s all connected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like manipulating my teams (I Wanna S(c)hoop and Darren’s Autograph, respectively) and adding to the roster based on whoever’s hitting the hardest or hits a weakness. And, much like a baseball utility player or a solid FLEX play in football, my fantasy video games are checking multiple boxes. I’m reading more, hanging with friends more, working on my novel, spending less time by myself in front of a television. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, in the long run, I’m not sure if it’s sustainable. I don’t know if I can really wrap my head around sports fandom. I don’t know if I can latently prop up inequitable systems like the NFL and MLB. In the short-term, I can will away my scruples. In the long? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, I can chat with my friend’s husband or the rando at the airport about things I kind of care about. I’m able to have content-based debates at work about Odell Beckham Jr. and Colin Kaepernick (both of whom I support, for the record). And simply paying attention to sports and seeing athletes run and jump, physical exemplars, it inspires me to keep fit and active. Even if there’s cognitive dissonance with the whole experience, there’s nothing complicated about my own health. I’ve lost thirty-five pounds since I’ve begun the latest season of fantasy sports. I’m running faster, breathing better, and feeling more alive than in a long time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe there’s something good about the whole thing. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch.tv</a> is a weird phenomenon. It’s an entire medium devoted to watching others play video games. The viewers are likely not playing along, like a video game version of Bob Ross’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Painting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Joy of Painting</em></a>, but are instead watching (like I do with Bob Ross). The difference is that it’s not watching the creation of art by a soothing hippy, it’s instead watching some random human play a game created by an entirely separate third party. It’s another step of removal from actual activity; instead of doing something (like life), or at least playing a simulacrum of life (like video games), it’s spectation. A box within a box within a box.</p>
<p>I don’t get it. Or, to put it another way, I totally get it.</p>
<p>The animated mini-series <em>Castlevania</em> debuted on Netflix on July 7. My friend Brian posted effusive, over-the-top praise on Facebook the day after it came out and, buoyed by his fanboyism (and <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/netflix-castlevania-broke-rotten-tomatoes-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rave reviews</a>), I gave it a try the next day. I like anime, I like <em>Castlevania</em>, I had just finished rewatching the 5<sup>th</sup> season of <em>Friends</em>. Why not give it a try?</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2-give-it-a-try.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2200" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2-give-it-a-try.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="299" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2-give-it-a-try.jpg 446w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2-give-it-a-try-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></a></p>
<p>A few hours later, I was finished. The animated <em>Castlevania</em> was…fine. Good in its way. While I prefer anime with multiple layers of text and meaning, a la <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> and <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, I also appreciate a good slash-fest for what it is. And <em>Castlevania </em>was a good ol’ slash-fest, heavy on action and oration. It reminded me of <em>Ninja Scroll</em> in a lot of ways, if <em>Ninja Scroll </em>was based on the <em>Castlevania</em> video game franchise that started in 1986 with <em>Castlevania</em> and continues through today, with 2014’s <em>Lord of Shadows</em> <em>2</em> the most recent iteration.</p>
<p>The Netflix show was a relatively faithful adaptation of the 3<sup>rd</sup> game in the series, <em>Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</em> on the Nintendo. The game’s plot goes something like this: Dracula has arisen and one of the Belmont clan must stop him, as the Belmonts are sworn/destined to do (there’s a lot of continuity I’m not going to bother to address). Along the way, Trevor Belmont encounters 3 possible companions: the witch Sypha, the half-vampire Alucard, and the thief Grant. It’s a cool game and plays like the original <em>Castlevania</em>, a difficult, gothic side-scroller.</p>
<p>The animated series hits a lot of the right notes. Trevor is the star, as he should be—nearly every <em>Castlevania</em> stars a Belmont—and both Sypha and Alucard are introduced in near-canonical ways: Sypha casts spells and Alucard is a badass. And while the thief Grant was excised—likely to simplify plot—from the series, it’s already been approved for a 2<sup>nd</sup> season, so maybe we’ll be seeing him regardless. The four episodes serve mostly as introduction: a gathering of evil, backstory (lifted from PlayStation’s <em>Symphony of the Night</em>), the coalition fighters meeting one another and then, finally, the entry to Dracula’s fortress, the titular Castlevania, filled with Rube Goldberg machines, moving platforms and many, many flights of stairs.</p>
<p>Watching <em>Castlevania</em> was fun. I knew each step as it approached, but seeing the snap of Trevor’s implausibly long whip, ice missiles flying from Sypha’s hands, the smooth, inhuman motions of Alucard thrilled, reminded me why I loved <em>Castlevania </em>mythology. And the addition of Alucard’s backstory from <em>Symphony </em>(the only game to not star a Belmont) thrilled. I’d always been partial to Alucard’s story, that of Dracula’s son who betrays his father to save humanity.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve never played <em>Symphony of the Night</em>, and I’ve certainly never played <em>Dracula’s Curse</em>. I’ve never even watched them. I know about them only in the abstract.</p>
<p>See, I played the original <em>Castlevania</em> when I was a kid and loved it. But, as I’ve said in <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/06/20/retrogamer-never-about-sonic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other articles</a>, I’m not much of a platformer. Timing, memorization: not my strong suits. I am driven more toward combination play (fighting games) or strategy and micromanagement. My natural skills lie to that direction, and nowadays I rarely deviate. But I was seven when <em>Castlevania</em> came out and I didn’t know my strengths. So I tried and I tried. I never beat <em>Castlevania</em>, never did see Dracula, but I did OK. I got to Medusa a few times. She beat my ass, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Instead-of-persisting.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2201" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Instead-of-persisting-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Instead-of-persisting-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Instead-of-persisting-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Instead-of-persisting-768x480.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-Instead-of-persisting.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of persisting, I tried to convince my brother to beat it. He was eleven and way more into platformers. But he didn’t really like <em>Castlevania</em>; it freaked him out, what with the ghouls and the monsters and the pincers. He also frustrated easily, and the <em>Castlevanias</em> are unforgiving games. So while he was better than I was, he wasn’t exactly “good.” And I didn’t get any satisfaction from watching him play.</p>
<p>But there was a kid at school who bragged about beating it. I didn’t like the kid much, but I wanted to see <em>Castlevania</em> beaten so I invited myself over and he played the game until the end and there was much rejoicement. Of course, I had to spend the rest of the night with the prat, but that’s really not the point.</p>
<p>The point was that even as an elementary school kid, I knew there were certain skills I lacked and that others possessed. I loved stories about vampires and ghosts and I liked the idea of <em>Castlevania</em>. But I wasn’t good enough on my own. Much like Trevor himself, I needed others on my quest. I watched someone else do what I couldn’t. It was enough.</p>
<p>Later, <em>Simon’s Quest</em> came out on the NES, and my brother and I tried that too. But it was far different from <em>Castlevania</em>, an open-ish world RPG-inspired nightmare of a game. It was too non-linear and confusing (and too similar to <em>Adventure of Link</em>, which we despised) so I doubt we gave it more than a few hours of play. This was back in ’88; the last time I played a <em>Castlevania </em>game was during the Reagan administration.</p>
<p>So how in the hell do I know Alucard’s backstory? How do I know who Trevor Belmont is? This isn’t knowledge that arrives via osmosis, like talk radio or work conversation.</p>
<p>In ’97, <em>Symphony of the Night</em> hit the PlayStation. It’s a well regarded game that is, arguably, the highlight of both the PlayStation AND the <em>Castlevania</em> series. Alucard steps into the role normally held for the Belmonts after Richter Belmont disappears. Gameplay is non-linear, exploration-based with RPG elements. And I’ve never played it. But Brian did and he updated me irregularly throughout ’98 and ’99. I was in another state for college, but I came home regularly enough for parties or laundry.</p>
<p>Each step of the way, as Brian played <em>Symphony of the Night</em> and mastered its intricacies, he told me the story as it unfolded. From him, I knew that Richter Belmont was (indirectly) possessed by Dracula, that the castle where the action takes place flips upside down halfway through he game and features new enemies and secrets, that it’s possible to get over 200% completion (through a glitch), and even that in the New Game + mode, one can play as Richter for a new, more difficult experience. He told me about buying weapons at the library, about the history of Alucard and Richter, about everything featuring <em>Symphony</em>. And he prefaced every conversation with, “If this is boring, I don’t have to tell you.”</p>
<p>And I’d always say, “No, I’m interested.” I used to say the same to a freshmen buddy about an X-Men spinoff series, <em>Mutant X</em>. We’d chat monthly and he’d update me on the newest comic. I didn’t want to read them, but I was invested enough to want to know what happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-know-what-happened.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2202" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-know-what-happened.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-know-what-happened.jpg 960w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-know-what-happened-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/4-know-what-happened-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>After Brian stopped playing <em>Symphony</em> is when I got interested in the mythology. And there weren’t any barriers, per se. Gamefaqs wasn’t the well-run, crazy-deep well of video game knowledge that it is today, but it more than served my purposes in 2000, when I created my account (I use the same account now). I surfed message boards and read excessively detailed FAQs on <em>Symphony of the Night</em> to fill in gaps, but I also dug into <em>Simon’s Quest</em> and <em>Dracula’s Curse</em>. As more games debuted, I read about them as well. I read walkthroughs and scripts to satisfy my hunger for this rich alternate world of the Belmonts and Dracula and Wallachia. I consumed just about everything easily accessible and then I moved on.</p>
<p>I never wrote fan fiction, but I may or may not have read a ton of it on now-defunct websites dedicated to it. I won’t say. But I will strongly imply.</p>
<p>After I was done reading the mythos, I moved on. I had an N64 at the time but didn’t pick up <em>Legacy of Darkness</em>. Nor did I feel moved to try my own hand at <em>Symphony</em>. I did other things, played other games. Despite my fascination with <em>Castlevania</em>, I didn’t want to play. I still don’t.</p>
<p>It’s not the games or the gameplay that entices me. I recognize that <em>Castlevania</em> is an exemplar of its type, of action-platform-RPG, but I don’t give a damn about the type. I don’t play <em>Metroid</em> anymore either, and I stopped playing <em>Zelda</em> games with the N64’s <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. But that doesn’t mean I don’t know what’s going on in those worlds. I keep up with it.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like when my wife, Leigh, watches those teen dramas <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> or <em>One Tree Hill</em>. I only half-watch them, but on the commercial, I have to ask, “I thought the Liars had figured out who the killer was” or “What’s up with my boy Skills?” And when she tells me, I do care. I internalize the history and the story and move on with my life.</p>
<p>We do this sort of exercise often. Cincinnatians who don’t give a damn about baseball, but will check in on the standings to see how the Reds are doing. Teenagers who don’t <em>really</em> care about their friend Missy, but want to know who she’s making out with. Readers who tapped out after <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> but scroll through Wikipedia just to see if Harry and Ron ever got their slash on. It’s the way we’re wired, curious apes who need to know what happens.</p>
<p>I tuned into the finale of <em>Lost</em> even though I’d only watched the first season. I read the synopsis for the final book in <em>The Hunger Games</em> trilogy. And after watching <em>Castlevania</em>, I pulled up the Wiki and read all about some games I’d never even heard of. <em>Harmony of Dissonance</em>? <em>Rondo of Blood</em>? I loved seeing how they all led into one another and referenced, called back. That Richter Belmont was the the main character in <em>Rondo of Blood</em> (badass name, that), then the ensorcelled villain in <em>Symphony</em>, which brought back Alucard from <em>Dracula’s Curse</em>? That kind of intricacy and layered mythology makes my head hurt and my heart happy.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5-my-heart-happy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2203" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5-my-heart-happy.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5-my-heart-happy.jpg 480w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/5-my-heart-happy-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a></p>
<p>It’s the same reason I like the <em>Fallout </em>series. If I’m going to not-live my life (and we can maybe agree that <em>watching </em>people game is to video games as masturbation is to sex), I want to not-live in a well built world. I want to feel like I’m swimming in art. Video games can be artful, and <em>Castlevania</em> is devoted to ensconcing the player in macabre, gothic wilderness. Watching the Netflix show felt like the fans weren’t served a platter of what they thought they wanted, but instead were given what they actually needed. It wasn’t faithful to the detriment of entertainment, but instead was a faithful interpretation, created by people who understood dedication to an ideal.</p>
<p>I don’t need to play <em>Castlevania</em> or <em>Simon’s Quest</em> or <em>Symphony </em>or <em>Rondo of Blood</em>, but I can sink into the water and let the surface cover me. And maybe I created a Twitch account and I’ve found some old <em>Symphony of the Night</em> play-throughs. I don’t know when and where I’ll have the time, but I’ll make sure to find it, because I want to see how that tale unfolded. I don’t have to participate to be part of the fun.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a feeling, once we achieve a certain speed, of flying, of lifting off from the ground, that flipping of the stomach, that lightheaded glee of gaining mastery of motion and gravity and time. It’s not a sustainable feeling because we are not built for that sort of life, lives of running, running, running. We burn out and fade to black if we sprint too hard and too fast. At least, that’s my experience, with life, with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic the Hedgehog, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with hurling forward, no brakes within reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This essay was supposed to be about mastering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was supposed to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because I’ve always wanted to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I’ve always wanted to be tautological, even before I knew what it meant. When I was young and Sega Genesis younger, I snatched moments to control the hyper-propelled blue hedgehog and thrilled at the zoom, at the woosh, at crisp color lines, at spikes that curled into a frantic ball. I cruised past the first few stages, hurling Sonic-body in circular anger at bees, across chasms, through easily marked rocks, at the mustachioed villain. But I only had those brief snatches in which to play, and the awkward black controller never melded to the hands of Child-me. As a child, I assumed that when my hands grew, when I found the time to play and the money to buy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for myself, I would. And as a child, there was no sense of urgency. But my hands never grew large enough, and time isn’t what it appears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know how time moves, glacial, at first, and then faster and faster until it’s a blitzkrieg rush and suddenly we’re grey and wrinkled and wondering, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who on earth is that old man in the mirror? Who is the old woman who can hardly bend to tie shoelaces?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Who are we? What happened to the possibilities? What happened to my life to make it so small, to fit it inside boxes and trunks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time decides for us. I never had time to develop most of what I wanted to develop, and time has lengthened and what’s ahead of me is still long, but not as long as it once was. I thought that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was what this essay was supposed to be about, would be on that road. It’s hard to wax philosophic about video games, about an optional luxury, when there are so many other ways to dip into existentialist crises. There are friendships undeveloped, lovers unloved, skills and hobbies unseeded. I could have learned piano, I could have learned drums, I should have learned one of them to set folks’ feet on fire, caused them to dance and sway in the wind, dripping sweat, screaming smiles, rictus faces. I didn’t learn music; I never learned </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There were too many other developments to pour resources into, a heady nectar into a cup drained from the bottom into an empty ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What magical thinking to imagine future time will be less precious, simple to spare it? Not only time, but interest, intuition, intelligence? That the intense focus we used to spare on whatever catching our interest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">look, a bird, look, books on Norse Mythology, look, anything at all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will come when we call it? That when we want to run, when we need afterburners, we’ll be able to concentrate like the days of old? Because it doesn’t work like that anymore. We (or at least I) have too much other </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I don’t like to do, that I have to will iron into my bloodstream in order to force attention to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s lawns to mow, chairs to repair, dust to whisk, endless supplies of dishes to clean and clothes to clean and everything to clean. There’s IRBs to write, DSM-Vs to memorize, reports and audits to conduct because your job isn’t your passion and those acronyms aren’t going to embedded themselves into your brain when the field in which you grow fucks is starved by the lack of rain. Just because you think you want to learn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your brain doesn’t spark joy when you sprint and twirl into the air. When the mustachioed terror comes down in his little hover car and whips a giant ball and chain at you and you die and start over at the beginning and you think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this isn’t that fun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What kind of road is that to force yourself down, when you force yourself down so many highways every day you live?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2126" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2.jpg 640w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only so much time for joy these days. Rationing joy is counter-intuitive, so anti-joy, but it’s hard to appreciate rainbows, difficult to encapsulate a moment of inhibition-free dance, challenging to laugh without inhibition, when the weight of necessity bears shoulders to the earth. Joy shouldn’t be forced, not when bulwarks to life need to be pushed against the flood. I’m not going to force fun when there are better alternatives. I can’t force </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I can’t force platforming like a square peg when life has so many round openings. Maybe there’s a reason for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t ever much of a platformer. Select classics aside, timing jumps and avoiding patterned-enemies didn’t so much bring me pleasure as I aged. Sure, I played them, but they were asides, temporary pleasures. And there were other elements driving me more; the ninja panic in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaiden</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, absurdity of magic mushrooms and fireball plumbers in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Mario</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cannibalistic ingenuity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mega Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for all its hedgehog oddity, never had that extra. It seemed forced, a sped up, dumbed down, pallette-enhanced non-entity. It had the soul of Bennigan’s, the magic of made-for-TV adaptations. And without that 9th dimension, it was only a rapid platform, an artificial barrier to a journey explored and experienced. And an adventure is not what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is though an adventure is what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants to be. But this was never really about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventuring journeys are the lying name tags platformers wear, a road trip to the far side of imagination. But the journey is broken into digestible portions, moving platforms over open pits. Maybe that’s a perfect metaphor, maybe those disappearing/agitating/frenetic platforms that we slip from are exactly what life is. But maybe I don’t want my platformers to be too perfect, too dependent on skills I don’t have. Maybe I want my games to open my eyes and my heart, those weak, necessary organs that aren’t hard like bone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After failing to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I tried other games on the disc I bought, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic Mega Collection, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loaded as it was with dozens of the Genesis’ very best. I tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecco the Dolphin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phantasy Star</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altered Beast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I tried, I tried, I tried but all I could think was that this is what’s happened to an entire system, reduced to a novelty that cost me $5 after store credit, during my store’s going out of business sale. We’re all going out of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know it’s all about data and that data is better these days and can hold more, but how can all of these </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eccos</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and all these games I’ve wanted to play since forever, how can they fit on a disc so small? It’s only been two decades. How can 20 years change so much? I’m still the same me, even if I’m larger, grayer, objectively older; inside, I’ve hardly budged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and remember, this isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and none of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic’s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">brethren struck a spark in me, I tried something else, a game I’ve read about in other, better </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Video-Games-Transformed-World/dp/0465039707" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essay-forms</span></a></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (maybe just more empirical, more data-driven). First I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, basic games, in the sense that the only goal is to go forward, where life gets more difficult, if not less beautiful. And I walk forward (or fly forward) and the world expands and eventually it contracts and it feels like nothing besides life. And then it slows and it’s all just images, images on a screen. And it was short and then over, but I felt something form. A memory, but not a memory past, memory future, because the second of joy whilst playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whilst playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mattered, and joy is to be held onto with a light fist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end, all we have of these journeys, these quests through space, dirt beneath toes, are memories and relics. And when we’re gone, those relics are boxed and put away or thrown into dumpsters. What happens to the sunlight we felt on our face when we were twelve? What happens to the castles built with wet sand, dripped from our fingers? Or the first time our lips touched another’s or the first cigarette we smoked, the way lungs burn with fire and ash? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can a lifetime’s worth of memories fit anywhere except infinity? And when an entire decade’s worth of imagination and hard work can be condensed into one little flimsy disc, it’s a symbol of our own continued obsolescence. Our own endless march to entropy. Our sped-up dash to the future-unknown. The hedgehog runs but gets nowhere, because video games are only ouroboros. Continue? Finish and start over? Continue? Finish and start over. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has only three lives but infinite press-starts. Our own lives don’t work that way, not unless the Hindus are correct (god, I hope they’re correct). </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a microcosm of nothing, only a segment, only a byte, only 1/32 of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic’s Mega Collection</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but this isn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is about taking a step forward, toward a distant mountain that can never be reached. About striving for excellence because excellence is strived for, because tautology is tautology and that’s enough. It’s about feeling because if there’s no point, the only reason for life is experiential, because moments have to matter. And finding moments of joy, of sublime reason, is starlight in angel wings. Feeling wind and sun and a friend’s palm on skin so that memory is tattooed with moments, endless moments upon moments, a glimpse of immortality.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2128" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video games feel a paltry way to connect with inner thoughts and beauty. And maybe they are. But they evolve as we do. They can be simple as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zork, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">text and text, and only a few years later, they encompass </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And not long after that, an odyssey where there is no violence, no death, only flowers bringing life to an empty land. They allow the mind, the endless ego, to connect. They allow us to reach across the void in small ways, as rickety rope bridges, as spiderwebs, they allow us obtuse angles into the greater known. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did that for those who live by whirling dervishes and souped-up nitro engines. Mad Max liked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Iceman and Goose played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the mess hall. Usain Bolt is tattooed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it’s not </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for me, but without </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who knows if I would have felt even a moment of joy, and I don’t discount joy lightly. For a few brief moments I felt pleasure when before, I felt nothing at all except mild discouragement, a scolding from a teacher, an eyeroll from a cashier, a honking horn maybe aimed at me, maybe not. And that’s enough to forgive a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe this isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but maybe that burst of speed was enough to get me to where I needed to be. Who cares if I don’t play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? I barely care myself. No, I needed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to remind myself to dedicate myself to what matters. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t matter but very little matters, only what we decide matters for ourselves. And I won’t waste that time.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is a struggle against failure. In every endeavor, we start by failing, failing mightily. That’s what learning is, correcting our mistakes and errors until, eventually, we stop being terrible, from learning to walk (and watching a child take its first steps is a reminder of how shitty we all begin at basic tasks) to advanced rocket physics and molecular whatnot. Failing is learning.</p>
<p>Start any video game and the beginning is full of fail. Games requiring high levels of twitch facility (think <em>Ghost and Ghouls</em> on the NES or <em>Fallout 3</em> on modern consoles) result in a lot of deaths early on, until the player masters the dexterity required and the particular skills that respective buttons are mapped to. From there, deaths tail off until new concepts are introduced, assuming an appropriate learning curve.</p>
<p>Some games, of course, are designed to be as difficult as possible, despite twitch skill. <em>Dark Souls</em> or <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> (any incarnation) are a slog of death, more death, all the death, until the player’s fingers move in perfect harmony to achieve victory. Watching a player who has mastered twitch-skill games can be joyful; it’s like doing an intricate, graceful dance, almost incomprehensible to those without the skill.</p>
<p>There’s purpose behind failure progression.</p>
<p>Before I talk about <em>Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</em>, a failure in so many senses of the word (but certainly not all), I want to talk about baseball.</p>
<p>Baseball, in so many ways, is the ultimate game of failure. For those who don’t know much about baseball—you may think it’s boring, or jingoistic, or its fans are troglodytes—baseball is about one player (the pitcher) hurling a small sphere at a minimum of 80+ miles per hour with as much spin as possible, so that it’s as difficult as possible for another player (the batter) to hit that sphere hard enough and skillfully enough that it can’t be caught by the rest of the players (8 fielders). There’s plenty of arcana besides that, but that’s enough for now. What’s important is that baseball is a game of failure.</p>
<p>The best hitters in the game fail to hit that sphere hard enough or skillfully enough to evade it being caught between 60% and 80% of the time. Ted Williams, arguably the best hitter of all time, only averaged 4 hits for every 10 pitches. He failed better than all the others, but he still failed. And besides hitting, baseball is a game where mistakes in catching the sphere (errors) are counted and cataloged and analyzed.</p>
<p>Pitching, however, is perhaps less a game of failure. Pitchers get knocked around from time to time, sure, but they’re the ones who are given a “Win” if their team wins while they’re still playing. The worst pitchers hover around a .500 success rate.</p>
<p>Curt Schilling, one of the driving forces behind<em> Kingdoms of Amalur</em>, was, in his first life, a winning baseball player, arguably one of the winningest in the past 20-30 years. Without delving into details that would overwhelm those who don’t dig baseball (obviously, I dig baseball), he’s been a member of three teams that played in the World Series of Baseball (winning three out of four), he was credited with the “Win” in 60% of games he played, and he won numerous individual awards for being an awesome pitcher. He’s (probably) going to get into the Baseball Hall of Fame and deservedly so.</p>
<p>That he seems to be kind of an awful human being and racist in his personal life is, for the sake of this conversation, kind of beside the point. In his public life, in a sport where failure is the norm, Curt Schilling is and was a winner.</p>
<p>So how did he fail so hard with <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em>?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with what <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em> is: a fantasy game, set in an expansive world. The player is the hero, setting out on a Hero’s Quest. Along the way, the PC meets people, some friends, many irrelevant “flavor,” and many, many enemies to be slaughtered, because it’s a hack-and-slash of the role-playing kind. The world is a sandbox, where the player can access most everything from early on. I like those kinds of games (<em>Fable</em>, <em>Jade Empire</em>, <em>Fallout</em> are comparable favorites of mine). And I liked a lot about <em>Amalur.</em></p>
<p><em>Amalur</em> is a beautiful game. Graphics aren’t particularly important to me beyond a baseline not-awful, but I stopped and stared often while touring the kingdoms. While the dungeons and houses have a lot of duplication common to open-world games—staircases in particular have a sameness to them—the rest is lush, unique, and painstaking. Some scenes—conversing with an enormous, magical tree in dappled sunlight for example—caused me to put my controller down and stare at art.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2Amalur_Nyralim.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2048" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2Amalur_Nyralim-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2Amalur_Nyralim-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2Amalur_Nyralim-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2Amalur_Nyralim-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2Amalur_Nyralim.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Besides its beauty, <em>Amalur</em> is complex. Battle mechanics allow for stealth-murder, brute force, and magical destruction, a cornucopia of combinations to complete the hundreds of quests, tracking the breadth of the many kingdoms (one of the first quests activated is designed to be one of the last finished: finding and collecting 10 books of smut). Character design and equipment allow for many builds and styles, and crafting, for those who like making shit, is extensive (and game-breaking).</p>
<p>The gameplay itself, the twitch, is also entertaining. While the challenge slowly bled out, much like all the victims of my murdering, switching fighting styles to match the encounters was a blast. As a good twitch-game should, it started out just hard enough, forcing me to figure out the controls, how to block and dash, roll and cast spells, how to cycle through weapons to best serve a situation. Fighting a pack of brownies might require use of knives or fae blades (sort of like bladed tonfa), but encountering humans might mean I needed to use longswords, while trolls might necessitate hammers and ball lightning. I gravitated toward speedy assassin-style fighting, while summoning zombie helpers and blasting weakened enemies from a distance.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3Amalur_fae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2049" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3Amalur_fae-1024x640.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3Amalur_fae.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3Amalur_fae-300x188.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/3Amalur_fae-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The plot, while not groundbreaking by any means, is serviceable. The avatar awakens atop a pile of corpses, the first successful rebirth of mortal life, and is given great power, outside the control of fate, and is thrust into a war. The war (and world) is a blend of old Irish, English, Scottish, and Germanic tales of faeries and elves: the mortal (elves, gnomes, and humans) and the immortal (faeries of Summer and Winter Courts). Some of the Winter faerie have gone rogue and are winning a war—only the player character can stop them with the powers given through rebirth and “reckoning.” Engaging enough, mostly because the exploration of Summer and Winter Courts have been left outside the pop culture gestalt (except for the Dresden Files series of pulp fantasy) and is thus novel.</p>
<p>Over the course of two months, I spent 70 hours exploring the kingdoms and slaughtering hordes of enemies. I completed a hundred-plus quests, from collecting the aforementioned smut books to singlehandedly turning the tide of a war. My avatar, Leigh Regatta, became stronger and stronger through level gains, faction bonuses, weapon and armor upgrades, and intense training. For the $9.99 I spent to buy it used from my local (now closed) independent vendor of nerd stuffs, I more than got my money back.</p>
<p>So why did a game I’ve enjoyed so much turn out a failure?</p>
<p>Curt Schilling, in addition to being a fabulous athlete and a winning pitcher (and a diehard, seemingly racist, conservative mouthpiece <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/04/16/huffington-post-explains-how-aggrieved-white-men-curt-schilling-find-home-breitbart/216044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now shilling</a> for Breitbart) is also an avid gamer. I’m no longer surprised when famous folks are into video games. If actor Matthew Perry asked to be involved in <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> because of his fandom, if pop star Justin Bieber and rapper Snoop Dogg play <em>Call of Duty</em>, if MMA fighter Ronda Rousey plays <em>World of Warcraft</em>, it shouldn’t be a shock that a 50-year-old pitcher has been obsessed with PC gaming since the<em> Everquest</em> days. It’s just how the world works; celebrities are people, too.</p>
<p>What’s unusual in Schilling’s case is that he took his interest in gaming to a higher level and, after retiring from baseball with $50 million, started his own video game company: 38 Studios, named after Schilling’s jersey number. I remember reading about it at the time of the studio’s founding. I wondered what the connection was between playing games, being a successful baseball player, and running a tech startup.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/4Amalur_38.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2050" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/4Amalur_38.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="341" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/4Amalur_38.jpg 600w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/4Amalur_38-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Apparently, there’s no connection at all.</p>
<p>38 Studios released one game and one game only before firing its employees and going under. It, and Curt Schilling, have been under investigation since the 2012 shuttering of its doors in both civil and criminal domains. The entire state of Rhode Island, where 38 Studios was based, is embroiled in this mess, suing 38 Studios and Schilling to recoup a multi-million dollar loan. According to some <a href="https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2012/11/01/rhode-island-sues-38-studios-to-recoup-losses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sources</a>, debt accrued by the company is around $150 million.</p>
<p>I’m not an investigative reporter, nor am I particularly interested in the details surrounding this whole situation, which, I am sure, is exceedingly complicated (and definitely still <a href="http://turnto10.com/news/local/court-hears-arguments-for-releasing-38-studios-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing</a>). I can accept the facts. Schilling evidently lost his entire fortune in this nonsense. He’s been close-mouthed on the shenanigans, going on record only a handful of times, sometimes to shift blame, sometimes to get people to stop asking him questions about what is obviously (and reasonably) a <a href="http://turnto10.com/news/local/curt-schilling-doesnt-apologize-for-failed-38-studios-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sore subject</a>. Maybe someone committed fraud, maybe it was simple mismanagement. Whatever the reason, 38 Studios failed and failed miserably.</p>
<p>Is there a lesson to be learned?</p>
<p>Despite enjoying the heck out of <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em>, I’d be hard-pressed to call it a good game. Quality and enjoyment do not necessarily make a 1:1 ratio. I like a lot of media that I wouldn’t say are objectively “good.” I’m clowned anytime I mention that Nickleback song I like; I watch rom-coms starring Julia Roberts unironically; when I ate meat, trash-meat was my favorite, like scrapple or gas station chili dogs. A long time ago, I realized that taste meant nothing and elitism in pop culture is bullshit. I like <em>Amalur</em> and don’t really care what others think, or even if it’s actually good.</p>
<p>But I can objectively say that <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em> in a few respects is, despite being enjoyable, a failure. For one, it’s far too easy to break any sort of difficulty curve with proper crafting, by completing too many side quests and receiving bonuses thereof, or even by power-leveling and equipment farming. Balancing an open-world game is an important step that is often overlooked; <em>Fallout 3</em> is another example of difficulty-breaking (addressed in its sequels).</p>
<p>But difficulty-breaking isn’t the only reason <em>Amalur</em> fails. Besides that, the sheer number of quests becomes overwhelming. After I’d finished the 60th thinly-disguised fetch quest, I began to tire. While the main quest (save the world, beat the evil army, kill the God) was investing enough and the Faction quests had depth behind them, the many, many nonessential side-quests bled the game dry and artificially inflated the length of the game. I can see how some people would love them; I am not one of those people and, based on a cursory review from critics, I am not alone.</p>
<p>(Also, let’s not forget the ridiculousness of the title. As my wife Leigh said, “<em>Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning </em>sounds like the kind of invented nerd game <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> would feature as an example of absurd nerdery.”)</p>
<p>Still, the lack of difficulty and overload of quests wasn’t enough to spell doom. The boring story was. For me, story is king and “serviceable” doesn’t cut it. An evil God and a bloodthirsty empire: ho-hum. While the extensive world-building in books and conversations with NPCs to fill <em>Amalur</em> out is impressive, it’s also essentially detached from the plot. With an overwhelming glut of “stuff” already, searching for optional clues about the world feels pointless.</p>
<p>If more of <em>Amalur</em> had been as well done as the art and gameplay, it might have been a good game. But it wasn’t; it didn’t “work.” Whatever magical concoction a game requires to be considered good, <em>Amalur</em> doesn’t have it. That I enjoyed it doesn’t sway my opinion. I like eating a family size bag of potato chips in one sitting: doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.</p>
<p>Now, Curt Schilling I don’t like. On a basic level, he played for the Red Sox, a division rival of the Os. But more to the point, I don’t like his politics, and I didn’t like him as a baseball player. I thought he was arrogant and racist (recently <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/news/curt-schilling-believes-adam-jones-lying-racial-taunts-221447957.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he inserted himself into a public story of racism by claiming, for some reason, that Baltimore Oriole Adam Jones</a> made up a story about being called the n-word while playing in Boston. But my distaste aside, I can’t truthfully say he was a bad pitcher. There are objective metrics in this world and by all of them, Curt Schilling was a talented ball player.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5Amalur_Schilling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2051" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5Amalur_Schilling-1024x759.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="474" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5Amalur_Schilling.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5Amalur_Schilling-300x222.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/5Amalur_Schilling-768x569.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>But by equivalent metrics, <em>Kingdom of Amalur </em>was a failure. It didn’t do enough right to make it a satisfying experience, and it didn’t save the studio that created it from bankruptcy. According to then-governor of Rhode Island <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/73968/kingdoms-of-amalur-needed-3-million-sales-to-break-even/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lincoln Chafee</a>, it “needed to sell 3 million copies to break even.” That didn’t happen. It failed.</p>
<p>We learn from failure, from falling on our face and applying lessons to the future. But those lessons aren’t necessarily transferable from one mode to another. I’ve failed many, many times, and I’m going to fail more, but I’m getting better at everything I’ve tried (except ice skating). But even when I achieve proficiency, I’m not going to expect to apply that proficiency to a different field. Just because I’m an adequate writer doesn’t mean I’d make an adequate filmmaker or sprinter or game designer. Michael Jordan didn’t become a good baseball player when he switched from basketball. I mean, he was better than me and probably better than anyone who will read this, but he wasn’t good enough.</p>
<p>I have to assume that Curt Schilling assumed that mastering baseball and mastering video game playing would be enough. They weren’t. But within<em> Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</em> was a lot of really good design, even if the pieces didn’t fit to create a whole. Getting <em>Spawn</em> artist Todd McFarlane to illustrate the game was a bold, wonderful move. Hiring R.A. Salvatore to write the text was smart also. <em>Kingdoms of Amalur</em> didn’t work, but there are nuggets of wisdom to take away from it.</p>
<p>Schilling is out of the video game industry, probably for good, so we may never see him learn from <em>Amalur</em>’s mistakes. He learned a different lesson, I suppose, since he now sticks to entirely different pastures. But who knows? Maybe others were watching and taking notes. Maybe they’ll avoid the same mistakes and succeed where he failed. That’s the only way we learn, right?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> since 1994. I’ve owned several versions, on the PlayStation, the Saturn, PS2, and PS3. There’s something about going into a city screen, instructing the PC to improve agriculture or city walls, then meeting with NPCs for wine just before marching to war against a nearby city-state that appeals to me. It’s a weird kind of  humanity.</p>
<p><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> is a long-running series with thirteen iterations, spanning 1985 through 2016. The premise never varies: playing as one of the over 250 characters in the game you attempt to unify China. It’s a world-building, army-fighting, character-recruiting epic. Characters age and die, alliances are formed and broken. Besides the insertion of magic (a device of the historical novel from which the series is adapted), it’s based in the real world, on real events that happened in China from 196 AD until 280 AD. It was an era of civil war that resulted in three rival kingdoms: northern Wei, South-Eastern Wu, and South-Western Shu, ruled respectively by Cao Cao, Sun Quan, and Liu Bei.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, Wei, usurped by the Jin dynasty, unified China. Historically speaking (for me), it was the basis in reality that made <em>Romance </em>resonate. Liu Bei really lived and died, a failed hero. So did Cao Cao, the main unifier of China, and even Lu Bu, the traitor. Each character (again, over 250 of them) has a brief bio to click on, to teach their segment of history.</p>
<p>The newest version, <em>Romance XIII</em>, is a brilliant game, hard and beautiful with new features I adore (I love that newer versions allow the player to be any character, not just rulers). By all rights, I should only be playing the most recent game. But I don’t. Mostly, I play <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire</em> on the PlayStation. It’s the first one I encountered and I’ve spent hundreds of hours on it. But I don’t play it for enjoyment, not exactly.</p>
<p>Recently, I went through difficult times. Aside from the depression that I’ve ignored (until recently) off and on, for my entire life, there’s simply been a lot of death around me. And my moods have been the blackest of my life. And it was during this period that I found myself unmotivated to start anything new, but craving <em>Romance IV</em>. And when I played, when I allowed the hours to tick by in my measured domination of ancient China, I found myself feeling better. Not a lot, necessarily, but marginally. Enough to get myself out of the house to work, to meet friends, to work out. To show up to life.</p>
<p>It’s like I needed a hint of comfort, a way to drain my brain of negativity and fill it with…emptiness. A comforting emptiness, a zen-like relaxation. It wasn’t a state I needed for long, just a temporary pit spot on the way to happier times. But I realized that, over the years, I’d dipped back into <em>Wall of Fire</em> precisely during these hard times, when I needed that brief boost. It was soothing, comforting, a warm bath.</p>
<p>When I discovered my motivation, simple and unmemorable as it may be, I wondered about other people’s. Why do we return to these games we’ve utterly mastered? To answer that question, I asked seven other writers what their “comfort food” was.</p>
<p>This is what they told me.</p>

<p><em>Dance Dance Revolution </em>(Arcade)<br />
by Anthony Moll<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I am no longer the 16-year-old boy with bleached hair and pierced face who spent hours on end playing <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> in the arcade of a shitty hotel-casino in Reno, Nevada. My body is no longer thin and unhindered, my feet no longer flick effortlessly along to late-90s techno and world beats. I am no longer a twink with punk rock leanings. Now more than double that age, I am a writer and academic, on medication to control my cholesterol. I’m not old, but I can no longer call myself young.</p>
<p>Like many living in the mid-Atlantic region, I find myself visiting Ocean City at least once during the summer season. The boardwalk there is typical of gaudy American tourism—saltwater taffy and visiting suburbanites, t-shirt stands every hundred yard selling tees with slogans like <em>YOLO</em> or <em>Less Government, More Guns</em>.</p>
<p>But the boardwalk also has arcades, and at least one keeps an old <em>DDR</em> machine. I make an effort to visit each year. I am only now realizing how restorative this annual tradition is, how much my body needs to be reminded of its history.</p>
<p>In America, where people of all backgrounds obsess over youth culture, we call the discomfort of aging into one’s thirties a “crisis.” For many queer men, this period can be especially disorienting, as we find ourselves struggling to find our place in subcultures that agonize over being small, young, and fit.</p>
<p>I am not immune to this obsession, but playing <em>DDR</em> reminds me that I can still move. I can still react. My body is still strong, and I do more to take care of it with each passing year. I don’t pretend that a dancing video game makes me young again, but for a moment each year—the length of three songs for a dollar—I move my body in a way that reminds me that I have not lost much, and I have gained both experience and taste as I’ve grown into adulthood.</p>

<p><em>Harvest Moon 64 </em>(N64)<br />
by Tabitha Blankenbiller</p>
<p><em>Harvest Moon 64</em> is a pixel-rendered love letter to melancholy, opening with a cut scene on your grandfather’s deathbed. In the background, a MIDI melody evokes the inevitable churn and crush of seasons. You inherit his farm in a Japanese mountain village and are tasked with bringing the blank, fertile space back to life. This is a place where generations have lived and died like perennial plants, returning in the legacies of their children. It’s a town where vocation defines personality: Karen at the vineyard is “sassy,” Ellie the baker is “sweet,” Maria the librarian is “shy,” and Popuri the flower shop attendant is debatably sentient. The avatar’s blank back story—he’d grown up in “the City” and hadn’t visited this close-knit community since childhood—were thin lines I rendered with my own small town ennui. My family moved from “The City” of Tacoma, Washington up to Mt. Rainier’s foothills when I was 12, and in the three years between the relocation and <em>Harvest Moon’s</em> release, my trepidation over our new home blossomed into hate. I blamed the new tiny town for my loneliness, boredom, awkwardness, and inconsequence. <em>Harvest Moon</em> was a meditation set in the world I claimed to despise, and I visited every day for hours. There was a strange excitement in slowly building a life, and the way pushing a button to water the plants mimicked nurture. I crafted the quickest, most efficient method to riches (investing in cows and corn) and learned the hiding spots of all the rare items scattered around the limited world. I lived enough lifetimes to woo and marry every girl in town. I savored the night a mysterious visitor showed up at the bar, knowing she’s programmed to never return. The routes I created through this mirage are still in my muscle memory when I sink back into the game, every few years in a dark stretch of boring winter, as my 20-year-old N64 grows ever glitched. I still tear up when I hear the opening song, the electric notes dredging up all the old drafts of myself playing a dozen versions of this boy on his farm. The beautiful boundaries of the town reflected what I couldn’t appreciate until I moved away to a new City for college, then grew up and moved back to another Nowhere. <em>Harvest Moon</em> teaches the peace of structure and the weary sadness of finite youth; the mortality of The City against the Mountain.</p>

<p><em>Super Mario World</em> (SNES)<br />
by Catherine Kyle</p>
<p><em>Super Mario World </em>was the third game I ever got, after <em>Albert Odyssey </em>for the Sega Saturn and a <em>Sailor Moon </em>fighting game for the SNES. At age 10, I came home from school one day to find my dad playing, clad in pajamas, bare toes pressing into the carpet with each of Mario’s jumps. “Surprise,” he said casually. He loved gaming as much as I did, but we were only just learning this.</p>
<p>In <em>Understanding Comics</em>, Scott McCloud argues, “The more cartoony a face is, […] the more people it could be said to describe.” Thus, generic faces are easier for viewers to project themselves onto than highly detailed ones. I think the same could be said of interactive stories.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>Mario </em>is pretty straightforward: a monster has abducted a princess and it’s Mario’s/your job to rescue her. Though Mario is an adult male plumber, he and his story are generic enough that a tween girl and her sommelier father could relate to him. And not just relate to him, but take advantage of the story’s simplicity to fill in gaps with their imaginations.</p>
<p>Playing <em>Mario </em>as a kid felt like going on a quest. Not just one I was experiencing vicariously, but one I was actively co-creating by heightening drama, inventing backstory, and adding dialogue in my mind. The sparseness of the narrative provided by the creators launched flights of imagination I still recall—and enjoy—to this day.</p>

<p><em>Goldeneye 007</em> (N64)<br />
by Steven Leyva</p>
<p>Growing up in Houston, Texas, under its ubiquitous humidity and sprawling beltways, I spent many hours during the summers walking between two friends’ homes to play N64’s <em>GoldenEye 007</em>. The three of us, James, Brentley, and myself, could affectionately be called late90s blerds, though we also played basketball and did step team and various other machismo-inspired activities. Playing video games, however, was our raison d’être—that and James had an older sister was as fine as Tisha Campbell in <em>House Party</em>—and our game of choice was this FPS masterpiece, where you could drop proximity mines, duel with slaps only, and fire rocket launchers all in the guise of characters from the Bond movie canon.</p>
<p><em>GoldenEye</em> was the like the ¼ pounder w/ cheese of video games, instantly satisfying and available at all hours of the day. Looking back, however, we probably treated those gaming sessions as a poor person’s summer camp. Each of us lived in separate but nearby apartment complexes; each alone most of the day while our mothers worked. We were unabashedly poor in our detailed ironing of secondhand jeans into starchy perfection. Lord only knows how any of us even owned a Nintendo 64 at the time. There was something democratic and communal about <em>GoldenEye</em>, where the multiplayer was so superior to the story mode. Marx is probably playing it right now in the afterlife.</p>
<p>And sure there was a gladiatorial aspect to the whole affair, where our currency was acknowledged defeat and the rites of trash talk, but mostly I think we felt a sense of naked joy in wasting time. For that pleasure, I remain a glutton. These days I “play” <em>GoldenEye</em>, by watching Let’s Play videos on YouTube with my 6-year-old son​, while wondering if he will have his own clique of bad blerds to Bond with.</p>

<p><em>World of Warcraft</em> (PC)<em><br />
</em>by Tara D. Gillespie</p>
<p>I was a huge LOTR nerd. So, to say I felt at home running around a fantasy world as a bronze-armored wood-elf warrior is an understatement. It felt destined, in fact, because it had always been a far-fetched dream of mine. I’m still kinda waiting for my letter from Hogwarts because I’d be badass at spell casting.</p>
<p>When I discovered the <em>World of Warcraft</em> it was like <em>Everquest</em>, but WAY better. The colors were brighter, the music was soulful, the storylines were intense and emotional; there were maps! The time in-game seemed endless, questing, pursuing specific gear or pets, working on reputation and professions, fighting in PVP grounds, accumulating achievements, analyzing talents and my toon’s DPS output, and exploring two continents.</p>
<p>Fast-forward twelve years and I am still invigorated by the dooming bass drums and the heroic blares of horns that echo from my login screen. Sure, I played <em>Frozen Throne</em>, some <em>Starcraft</em>, and most recently dabbled in <em>Overwatch</em>, but I always feel the magnetic pull to play <em>WoW</em>. I don’t have a lot of free time nowadays with a toddler and grad school so, if I’m going to game, I’m going to play what I enjoy the most.</p>
<p>After playing <em>WoW</em> obsessively for years I’ve become emotionally attached to the world and my main character, a Night Elf Hunter named Tinweaura. We’ve spent a lot of time together, she’s seen me through break-ups and my chaotic twenties where I had no idea who the hell I was. If I felt lost IRL, I could always login where I felt sure of my actions and goals.</p>
<p>When I login now, I recognize my history; where I’ve been but also how I’ve grown. My friend’s list is a blur of inactive, greyed out names: old boyfriends and friends who I’d convinced to play, but who no longer play, mimic those relationships in real life. Where I was once concerned with being the best, insecure, if I didn’t use every opportunity to play to demonstrate I was a valuable player, I’m now at peace with logging in once in a while, sometimes just to take a fantasy-break amongst the pink cherry-blossom trees in Pandaria, or on top of an icy mountain in Northrend, or if I’m feeling really nostalgic, maybe fly home to the great tree island of Teldrassil because, really, who the fuck cares. The game will always be here.</p>

<p><em>Skate 2</em> (PS3)<br />
by Joel Hans</p>
<p><em>Skate 2</em> plays to some of my deepest obsessions: a respect for skateboarding as sport and art form, my love of steep learning curves, my endless desire to explore a territory. I’ve found myself cringing at the Hall of Meat, where the sounds of breaking bones are tallied into a score. That feature always fascinated me, to see pain made both objective and <em>the objective</em>.</p>
<p>Those crashes remind me of when I was a teenager, terrible at taking falls on my own skateboard, and how my left elbow received consistent blows, equipping me with an impressive <em>swellbow</em>.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by <em>Skate 2</em>’s approach to physical pain. After a crash, pressing L1 and R1 together teleports back in time and space to right before a fall. And there were certainly times I wished for such a feature in real life, to go back before the gap ollie where I caught my back wheels in the grass, my elbow finding concrete with all my bodyweight behind it.</p>
<p>All this fascination is amplified by the fact that my first sessions in <em>Skate 2</em> were with my dog, a 10-week-old puppy then, falling asleep in the gap between my two outstretched legs as I sat on the floor. So, yes, the game has sophisticated gameplay, a novel approach to physical pain, and a stunning isolated architecture of this endlessly skate-able city, but it also has a connection to a fully good time in my life.</p>
<p>I’ve flung myself into this beautiful anomaly: 200 hours and eight years later and I’m still finding new corners of the city, still cruising familiar streets, still playing with my dog nearby. I’m still pressing R1+L1 to go back in time. Still probing my elbow for the remnant of all that old pain: a little shelf of extra bone that shouldn’t be there, but is, and that’s okay.</p>

<p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> (N64)<br />
by Kerrin Smith</p>
<p>When <em>Ocarina of Time</em> first came out, I didn’t play it. Instead I compulsively watched my two brothers struggle with its puzzles and bosses—probably too advanced for elementary school kids—and I got hooked on <em>Ocarina</em>’s story and mythos. Like, utterly sucked in. Then one day my older brother, Devin, reported that he “lost” the cartridge. When I furiously confronted him, he confessed that he hadn’t actually lost it but lent it; he’d gotten frustrated, and instead of admitting he was stumped, he contracted our preteen neighbor. When we got the game back, he had been catapulted through the plot. The only way to fill in the missing chunks of story was to play it myself.</p>
<p>Even though my spectating had technically spoiled the end for me, the game still drew me in, because it was the first game that made me curious. It made me think, and look at situations and environments in new ways. In fact, I fondly remember the battle with mini-boss Dark Link as a lesson in creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>My 19th or 20th run of <em>Ocarina</em> was just a few months ago, and I still stumbled upon caves and treasure that were completely new. I’m playing <em>Breath of the Wild</em> now, and while this masterful new installment radically breaks from past Zelda gameplay, its essence of storytelling and discovery is the same as <em>Ocarina</em>’s, which is why Hyrule has been my alter-universe of choice for nearly two decades.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I play <em>MLB: The Show</em>, I always go straight to the manager’s tab. I click on my players and look at their stats, at trade offers. I see how much money is flowing in, check the status of my minor leaguers. I wonder at next year: will I be offering contracts to my mid-tier players? One of my mid-tier guys is Adam Jones and, in real life, he’s my favorite Oriole. But here, in this game, he’s my backup fielder. Is he worth it?</p>
<p>The next game is against a top pitcher (Clayton Kershaw, pitching for the Red Sox in this reality), and my top center fielder, Jacoby Ellsbury, is tired; his stamina bar is pretty low. I swap Adam Jones in and decide that if he does well here, maybe I’ll keep him around a bit longer. See if he’s worth it in the long run. What’s the point of fandom if you can’t be a fan?</p>
<p>After I’m done with player management, I check on my stadium. I have enough money to add some bleacher seats. My team (the Orioles) are doing quite well and have a ten-game cushion in the AL East. Fans are pouring in. I purchase the bleacher seats and up the ticket prices by $5/seat. It’ll pay for itself in a game or two. I nod, satisfied.</p>
<p>It’s only when I’m tapped out of management that I sigh and start the next game. I’m not particularly enthused about playing a full game. I think about turning off the fielding and letting the computer take over. I debate turning off the pitching. Instead, I leave it all on and decide to handle it.</p>
<p>When the game is over, I wonder, how in the world did I get here? I didn’t always like baseball.</p>
<p>I think about Kevin Costner. I think about <em>Field of Dreams </em>and <em>Bull Durham.</em> I love one of those movies and think it’s just about the greatest representation of what the sport can be. And the other? I think it’s the opposite. I think it’s about all the crap that people <em>want</em> baseball to be.</p>
<p>Kevin Costner? He’s fine, I guess. I liked <em>Waterworld</em> so maybe my opinion doesn’t count for much.</p>
<p>I never cared much about baseball. I enjoyed going to Orioles games, and I liked pretending to care who won. I liked being part of the crowd, the roar and groans. I liked cursing at opposing pitchers and seeing the sun set over the stadium, casting mile-long shadows. Playing it, I liked batting (I hit more homers than singles and walked more than I struck out, even if it was only little league), but I was medium-bad in the infield and hopeless in the outfield. But I liked being part of a team and saying we, we, we.</p>
<p>The only baseball game I played as a kid was <em>Ken Griffey Jr’s Major League Baseball</em>. This was before likeness rights beyond the title player, so the teams were thematic and named after reality. The Phillies are made up of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. There’s a team filled with horror directors and teams filled with mobsters. I could never figure out who the Orioles were. Who were J. Waters and T. Turnblad and C. Baby?</p>
<p>I mean, I know now. Programmers have senses of humor.</p>
<p>Back in those days, <em>Ken Griffey</em> was remarkable because it tracked the stats of your team. You couldn’t trade or cut players, there was no minor league, it was impossible to make an error…limitations, yes. But there was novelty in seeing characters grow with the season. And because it was in the days of the SNES, it was likely that after a season (which I rarely completed), I’d have four batters hitting .400 with 30 homeruns each.</p>
<p>To those who don’t know baseball, that’s a lot. That’s L33t-level pwnage, or whatever.</p>
<p>While I loved <em>Ken Griffey</em>, after I grew bored with it, I never picked up another baseball game. It was a rare blip in an otherwise straight trajectory of fighting games, RPGs, and the occasional racing game.</p>
<p>But there was always a kernel of interest. The Orioles. <em>Ken Griffey</em>. Little league. It would just take a while for that kernel to explode.</p>
<p>Enter 2008. It was the year I went out with my wife for our first date, and it was also the year I dipped my toe into fantasy sports. Soon after: <em>MLB: The Show ’11</em>, the newest (and admittedly only the second) baseball game I’ve ever loved. Here, I’ll show you the steps.</p>
<p>Step 1: Start dating a girl obsessed with a baseball team, specifically “your” team’s rival (in this case, the Red Sox).</p>
<p>Step 2: Meet her dad and brother, sports fanatics with encyclopedic knowledge of baseball in general and the Phillies in specific.</p>
<p>Step 3: Go to a bunch of games in your first year of dating just as <em>your</em> team—the Orioles—are turning around a decades-long flirtation with terribleness.</p>
<p>Step 4: Find yourself at an awkward work function where your co-workers are struggling to converse with you. They bring up sports, over and over.</p>
<p>Step 5: Become determined to make office small talk (you’re there a lot) and read an article about fantasy sports. It’s too late for baseball, but football isn’t far away.</p>
<p>Step 6: Start an office-wide Fantasy Football league with the <u>express</u> purpose of being able to talk with your colleagues (who don’t give a shit about the arts, or movies, or recreational drug use, or anything you give a shit about).</p>
<p>Step 7: Find yourself very, very interested in fantasy sports. Realize that constructing a team is basically like recruiting an RPG party. Pretend the Quarterback is the party leader, the Running Backs are knights, Wide Receivers are wizards. Pay attention to stats and know, instinctively, that you understand this. You’ve played games like this your entire life.</p>
<p>Step 8: Win your football league. Realize that you know way more about the New England Patriots’ two new Tight Ends and their tiny running back, amusingly named Woodhead, than you ever thought you would.</p>
<p>Step 9: Chase the dragon, that feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Step 10: Join a Fantasy Baseball League. Unleash the beast.</p>
<p>Unlike Fantasy Football, I was in way over my head with baseball. Football’s easy: there are only a handful of important players to care about and, living in a football town like Baltimore, I had more osmosis-based knowledge than I expected. But baseball? There were <strong>eight </strong>position players to worry about and three different kinds of pitchers to plan for. I didn’t even know that “closer,” the dude who finishes the game in the 9<sup>th</sup> inning, was a pitching position.</p>
<p>And, during that initial fantasy draft, I had the number one slot and made my wife laugh very hard when I asked, “Hey honey. Who is Albert Pu-joles? Is he any good?”</p>
<p>Leigh laughed from downstairs and shouted up at me from where I hovered over the computer, nervous. “Are you kidding? He’s the best baseball player of the past five years. He’s a first baseman for the Cardinals.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, should I draft him? Is that good?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer me, and I went ahead and plucked the slugging first baseman onto my lineup. I filled out the rest of my lineup more or less at random, though some miscellaneous guys with cool names (Jose Reyes and Jacoby Ellsbury) found their way onto my team. When the draft finished, I thought that maybe I’d made a mistake.</p>
<p>But no, I wound up winning that league as well. Obsession kicks in unexpectedly.</p>
<p>It was after three years of Fantasy Baseball that a PS3 came into my possession, along with a single copy of <em>MLB: The Show</em>. If it had been a couple years earlier, I would never have bothered. What interest would Mike of the mid 00s have in a baseball game? He knew nothing about baseball.</p>
<p>But things had changed. I knew more about the game than I even thought I did. So, I figured, what the hell, and stuck in the disc. I was immediately blown away by how many <em>options</em> it gives. Now, I know that’s not exactly a hot take for anyone who’s been playing these sports games since they debuted in ’06, but for someone like me, who hasn’t picked up a game like this since the <em>90s</em>, well, it was a revelation.</p>
<p>There’s something about having near-total freedom in a video game that appeals to some people. It’s why sandbox games like <em>Fallout</em> are so popular; yeah, there’s a de facto plot and route to take, but there’s also a whole world to explore and little nooks and crannies to shine some light on. And while the actual game of <em>The Show</em> is well done, it’s also to-be-expected. Pitching, fielding, hitting: none of it has changed dramatically since my days of <em>Ken Griffey</em>.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the available players weren’t even <em>born </em>when I was playing <em>Ken Griffey</em>. But that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>What I love about baseball isn’t really baseball. The sport itself? Mildly boring, though I appreciate the skill it takes (a lot like golf, if way more watchable). It’s the accoutrements of baseball that I get into. Trading, draft picks, management. I like how all of that <strong>stuff</strong> creates this gestalt that becomes greater than the simple game. I dig being in a fantasy baseball community and posting trash talk on message boards.</p>
<p>The only thing I like about a real baseball game? Being in the crowd or in front of the TV with friends, watching together. That sense of community. I like how when I wear my one article of Orioles clothing (a Wei-Yin Chen shirt, in Korean), I get knowing smiles and compliments from strangers. It’s like joining a pack. It might be why other people join fraternities: friendship and common language, a set of rules to follow, easily and quickly.</p>
<p>What I like about baseball, to be tautological, is the process of liking baseball. I enjoy the process, not so much the game. I don’t care about the individual players that comprise the Orioles—except maybe Adam Jones, who seems to run out of fucks—so much as I like what the Orioles represent. They represent me and my friends watching baseball.</p>
<p>It’s an odd sense of detachment, to not actually care about a thing you ostensibly really care about. It’s ritual, it’s community, it’s all of the trappings, not baseball itself.</p>
<p>Playing <em>MLB: The Show</em> enabled this kind of enjoyable detachment. I liked knowing that all across the nation, there were countless people just like me, doing the same thing. Taking that knowledge gleaned from the video game and applying it to fantasy, or conversations with my in-laws, or even seeing players I had “owned” in real life games. It just enriched and deepened an already existing pleasure.</p>
<p>There’s nothing mystical about baseball. It’s a messy, physical, cynical exercise in money-making. The owners, the players, they (often) don’t give a damn about what the game represents. No, that’s what fans project onto the game. I like the intricacy of it, like a living organism. I like contracts and hot dog vendors and applying numbers to an abstract concept. WHIP or WAR, they don’t mean shit. But they matter, because we care.</p>
<p>It’s why I love <em>Bull Durham</em>, a movie about minor league baseball players. And it’s why if I never watch <em>Field of Dreams</em> again, it’ll be too soon. Because one is a snapshot of what baseball is, and the other is a lie that we tell ourselves.</p>
<p>What I love about <em>Bull Durham</em> is the messiness of the whole thing. It’s rooted in the bones and blood and piss of real life. When the two unrequited lovers (played by Costner and Sarandon) meet for the first time, they talk about what they love of the game. Costner says, “I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman&#8217;s back, the hangin’ curveball, high fiber, good Scotch, that the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent, over-rated crap. I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.” It’s a real moment, if over-eloquent. And it’s true for Costner’s character: he loves that physicality, that movement and adrenaline.</p>
<p>But Susan Sarandon’s character, what she loves more than that is being part of something. She doesn’t have delusions that baseball is this grand, powerful majesty. It’s just a thing that she loves and if she can be a muse, a teacher, then she’s happy to do so. She’s caught up in the religiosity of it all, as she says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe in the Church of Baseball. I&#8217;ve tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones. I’ve worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan. I know things. For instance, there are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary and there are 108 stitches in a baseball. When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance. (<em>sigh</em>) But it just didn&#8217;t work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me. I prefer metaphysics to theology.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s the combination of these that makes <em>Bull Durham</em> work. This rooted-in-reality mythology. As opposed to <em>Field of Dreams</em>, which is rooted nowhere. Except maybe the clouds.</p>
<p><em>MLB: The Show</em> somehow tapped into my new love and admiration of baseball by reveling in the minutiae of hot dog vendors and yet being a deep, interactive simulation at the same time. I could draft my fantasy team and simultaneously build bleacher seats. I could be a part of something greater and still focus on fundamentals. I love sabermetrics, and I love the idea of a 5-tool prospect, but I’m fully cognizant of the artificiality of the whole construct. And there’s nothing more constructed than a video game.</p>
<p>The only thing important about baseball (and sports in general) is that millions of people think it’s important. Their projection of meaning gives the thing meaning. I know that. I know that I’m part of the narrative in a lot of ways, especially because I’m aware that the narrative is artificial. Sports are a metaphor, for life, for war (where else did sports come from but from battle simulations, however diluted), for community and tribe. Video games simulating those sports are one more level removed from the throbbing heart of it all. How real can it even be? How much difference can it possibly make?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe it’s important despite itself. At least, it is if we say it is.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first story I ever wrote was fan fiction. It was a mostly faithful transcribing of <em>Final Fantasy 2</em> (or <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>, going by the Japanese numbering convention), with the additions of inner thoughts, classic Adam West-inspired onomatopoeia (<em>THWANG! ZING! POW!</em>), and dialogue very clearly written by a ten-year-old boy, which is exactly what I was. Handwritten, 40-some pages long, it’s a treasured memento for my mother and a story I’m totally proud of.</p>
<p>Is my fanfiction good? Of course not. Does it matter that it’s terrible? Also: of course not. Am I embarrassed that I wrote a character, named Tageran, who appears ¾ of the way through and is suddenly the most powerful of all characters, with the most remaining lines? No: I was 10.</p>
<p>Not long after I wrote my treatise on <em>Final Fantasy</em> (inventively titled <em>Final Fantasy</em>), I wrote my second masterpiece, my own <em>Infinity War</em>, starring all of my favorite Marvel comics characters. Also handwritten—we didn’t own a computer until I was 14—this magnum opus spanned perhaps thirty pages and showed a complete evolution in writing. No onomatopoeia, no sudden introduction of self-named heroes, and quite a bit of death and destruction. If I recall correctly, it ended with the dissolution of the Marvel universe and four surviving heroes (Archangel, Hulk, Quasar, and Speedball) walking slowly in four different directions, into four distinct sunsets.</p>
<p>Sadly, the <em>Infinity War</em> is lost to time. Unlike <em>Final Fantasy</em>, my mother did not know of its existence and so didn’t save it. Oh well.</p>
<p>In college, I had some pretensions to writing, but did very little actual composition, so little that it dwindled to nothing for nearly a decade. But, while I wrote little original material, I was a frequent lurker and eventual contributor to two online forums: Planet Namek and Buffy.com, where I wrote several lost-in-time <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> fan stories.</p>
<p>I wish I could find those stories. There might have been something good in there.</p>
<p>In 2006, I came across a fan film that blew me away. And not for any ironic reasons, either. It was a film that was done purely out of love and looked fantastic. Sure there was groan-worthy dialogue, sure the plot was, at times, thin, but it was a labor of joy that inspired me. Of course, it was also a property that I adored. It was <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDxZkHCq4Tk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Revelations</a></em>, and I downloaded it over one of the last dial-up modems I ever had. It’s stayed with me ever since.</p>
<p>(I’ve also kept abreast of the developers of <em>Revelations</em>. <a href="http://www.trenchesonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some of them</a> are doing quite well. Perhaps the jump from fan-work to actual work isn’t as large as it sometimes appears.)</p>
<p>Watching <em>Revelations</em> was one of the key moments that led me back to writing and the arts: publishing, acting, even organizing theme nights at clubs and bars. Because even though it was within a property owned by someone else, there was such care and professionalism involved. It was the simple act of creating that inspired me. The venue of creation is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Fan fiction and fan development has long had a place in my heart. While I don’t tend to write specifically fan-based original stories anymore, to deny that I use my own fandom as a source in my writing would be a silly lie. Consider <a href="http://fortresspublishinginc.com/index_files/trb4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this story</a> I wrote several years ago while I was playing <em>Jade Empire</em>. The setting: a magical land based on Eastern myths and tropes. The plot and protagonist might be entirely removed, but the influence is apparent. And my appreciation of fan work never goes away. In fact, <a href="http://origintales.info/ultimatemasters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I seek it out</a> (the book linked there contains a mashup of <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Ramona</em>, as well as the best <em>Law and Order: SVU</em> fanfiction I’ve ever read).</p>
<p>Of course, the whole time I was watching fan films and reading fan stories, I was aware that there was an entire field of fan work that I never delved into. Fan hacks and remakes and balances of video games. Sure, I encountered fan hacks of video games (LAN parties in college of <em>Quake 2</em>, notably), but I never did more than dip my toe in. Call it trepidation or laziness or fear of viruses on my computer. Whatever the reason, I never bothered.</p>
<p>That is, until my friend Brian told me about <em>Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World</em>. I was dubious at first: <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> (or 3, depending on naming convention) was one of the first games I ever loved. It was, despite its age, almost a perfect game. “But,” Brian told me, “the people who hacked it fixed everything in it. They fixed the difficulty curve, the character-sameness, the broken AI, the broken spells. They even re-translated a lot of the dialogue.”</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy VI</em> debuted on the Super Nintendo in 1994 and blew me, and the rest of the role-playing world, away. It featured a larger cast, unprecedented customization of characters, non-linear gameplay, and a new steampunk world at a time when a North American audience did not expect such things (Japanese audiences were perhaps a bit more prepared). The story is both grand—an amnesiac woman with magical power is being chased by a malignant empire—and personal. Of the twelve main characters, each one is given a backstory and their moment in the spotlight, their own time to grow and move forward.</p>
<p>I spent hundreds of hours my sophomore and junior years of high school playing the hell out of it, exploring the world, poking my avatar’s heads into every nook and cranny. I remember the first time I found the Ancient Castle underneath the ground or the first time I beat Doom Gaze, the wandering monster. I remember the thrill of mastering the final Blitz, Bum Rush, or finding the Water Rondo, recruiting the two hidden characters (one obtainable only by allowing the party to be literally eaten). I mastered all of the mechanics and discovered literally every secret.</p>
<p>Every secret, but not every glitch.</p>
<p>As I said before, <em>FFVI</em> is an <em>almost</em>-perfect game. It has style, story, gameplay. The only mitigating factor in its perfectness is how broken it is. And it’s very broken. There are glitches everywhere, from walking through walls to beat minor quests, to exploiting bugs that play off each other to wipe out bosses with one-hit spells (Vanish/X-Zone), to making a character never stop attacking (the Psycho-Cyan glitch). There are programmed formulas that are nearly or entirely non-working (some of the stats, like Vigor or Evade, do very little) and special attacks that crash the game (like one of protagonist’s special commands, Sketch). It’s very, very easy to glitch the <em>FFVI</em> beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Beyond the glitches, there’s also poorly thought-out consequences of normal gameplay. The magic system is fairly intuitive. There are gems that the characters equip called Magicite. Once equipped, the characters learn magic. Easy enough. Except some of the spells are so absurdly powerful (e.g. Quick and Ultima) that once they are learned, they wipe out every enemy in one or two hits. Since every character can learn every spell, the end boss dies in half-a-dozen turns, owned entirely by multiple blasts of speedy characters nuking him with Ultima after Ultima.</p>
<p>For such a perfect game, <em>FFVI</em> is also kind of shit. Especially for replays; someone like me, who grew up playing it, knows every trick, every turn, every strategy. It’s hard to unlearn that when it’s so ingrained. Once mastered, it’s kind of not fun to play anymore.</p>
<p>This is why <em>Brave New World </em>was such a breath of fresh air. It fixed everything that was broken. And why I was so thrilled, so fanboy-ish, to reach out to the masterminds behind the hack.</p>
<p>According to one of the two mavens behind <em>Brave New World</em>, a gentleman who goes by the nom de plume BTB, “[<em>FFVI</em>] was good in the sense that it had potential. If you ask someone who likes it to think back on it, they’re going to look at it through nostalgia goggles. They won’t see the broken pile of code that vanilla <em>FFVI</em> is, they’ll see the game they want to remember it as. And really, the heart of this project was [me and Synchsi] just trying to make <em>FFVI</em> actually be that cool game we know it could have been.”</p>
<p>He refers, of course, to the massive editing and hacking he and his partner made to <em>FFVI. </em>BTB continues: “Names of items, how much they cost, who can equip them, spell parameters, etc. Like, 90% of [modding] is staring at a hole in a text document or a spreadsheet of character stats and setups and wondering if this one spell needs a buff or if I should lower this character’s speed or whatever. I just constantly put myself in the place of the player, look at the options I’m giving them, and think to myself&#8230;what option would I pick here? Is there a clear, obvious choice?”</p>
<p>The biggest fix that BTB and partner made in <em>Brave New World</em> was in the characters: their growth, their abilities. In the original (“vanilla”) version of <em>FFVI</em>, the characters all start unique and useful (a mage, a thief, a monk, etc.) but swiftly become interchangeable due to the character development design and the broken stat formulas. In <em>Brave New World</em>, that is all different. Only certain characters can learn certain spells and stat gains are all different for each one. So players have fast but brittle characters, slow tanks, magic users, and physical warriors, all of which have been tweaked to be useful. The re-balance required me to think, to plan, to figure out how to best use my characters. It broke me out of my hidebound adherence to rules from 20 years past.</p>
<p>BTB also says, “One of the things about <em>Brave New World</em> that I am most proud of is how every character is legitimately useful. Everyone has at least some player out there saying that they’re the best character in the game, which is what I was shooting for…I want to give the player interesting choices and the freedom to make them.”</p>
<p>That freedom to make choices is at the heart of modding an original game. The question has to be asked, though: why in the world would one spend time on an existing property? Why not create something original?</p>
<p>BTB told me, “Obviously it is much more work to create something original than improve upon something else—this is a fact that people who disparage the modding community like to throw in our face. But it’s more than that. We mod existing games because we see the true potential in them and we feel the world needs to see it. We mod a game to be a better version of itself, not something else entirely.</p>
<p>“I want everything to be the best version of itself. So often I am confronted with a busted, almost-good or almost-perfect facsimile of what<em> could be</em>. Maybe more time is needed, or more money, more motivation. In the case of <em>FFVI</em>, while what was created became an exemplar for the future, there was so much detail that could have been enhanced and tweaked to become just a little bit better.</p>
<p>“As a modder, I sort of feel like a quality control editor for the development team of a game. Obviously, I’m not the one who made it, but on that same token, when you spend longer than the original development cycle of that game cleaning up messes, you tend to harbor a very deep resentment. And that is tied to the real amount of work that I have put into it.”</p>
<p>That resentment is part of why we get so bent out of shape about the media that we love, when it isn’t treated with proper care and attention. The <em>Star Wars</em> prequels are obviously examples (while that care and devotions are what made <em>Revelations </em>so refreshing, despite its DIY flaws). But countless games have broken mechanics, game-ending flaws, or even aesthetic eccentricities that seriously detract from enjoyment. What I loved so much about <em>Brave New World</em> was that it rebuilt something I had enjoyed but knew had weaknesses. It shored up those weaknesses.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> is my favorite game. I don’t think it is, but it’s also not far from it. It’s in the top ten for certain, sometimes top five, depending on the day and my mood. But now that <em>Brave New World</em> is out, I don’t foresee going back and playing the original. Perhaps some people would, and I can’t blame them; there’s something to be said for canon and for adherence to a model. Me though? There’s a version that I think is superior, so why accept a substitute? It’s sort of like the song “Nothing Compares 2 U.” Even Prince admitted that Sinéad O’Connor’s version was better.</p>
<p>What I love most about fan versions of games (or anything) is that it takes the urge to create and refine art and uses it for sheer love. While there are occasions of fan art becoming mainstream (<em>50 Shades</em>, anyone?), generally speaking, it’s purely a labor without compensation.</p>
<p>I often wonder why I write about video games. I’m not getting paid, I’m not getting <em>direct</em> compensation from it, besides writing credit in a literary magazine. But that isn’t really the point. The point is that I love video games, and I love examining the whys and wherefores of games. I want to add to the mythology of games for others to hopefully nod their heads and be like, “Oh snap, I didn’t think of it that way.”</p>
<p>I’m not a coder, and I’m not a modder. I’m not really a fan-fiction writer anymore (though I do love the occasional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gronking-Remember-Book-Gronkowski-Erotica-ebook/dp/B00RN7TNHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan story</a> that crosses my path). But I am still a fan, and I’m going to add what I can.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year and a half, since writing <em>Retrogamer</em>, I’ve played quite a few games, many because I legitimately wanted to play, or because they were highly recommended, but also because I thought people wanted to read about it. And I gave them a fair try, but I couldn’t get into them, not enough to write a long piece about how much I hated them. I could barely muster the energy to finish an hour or two of these games, with one notable exception.</p>
<p>But, welcome to speed dating for video games.</p>
<h2><strong>I.</strong><em><strong> Halo 2</strong></em><strong> (Xbox)</strong></h2>
<p>I liked <em>Contra</em> and I liked <em>Goldeneye</em>. I even liked the original <em>Halo</em> when it first came out, despite minimal playing time (I was in college). I liked <em>Fortress</em> and all those early PvP games played on college servers. I fully expected to like <em>Halo 2</em>, especially now that I was giving myself time to really dig into it. But, I realized very quickly that I have better things to do than map out attack patterns for exploitation and the exact steps to run a gauntlet while following directions from some dippy AI named Cortana.</p>
<p>The crux of this is that I’m missing something with first-person shooters. I know I am. And Halo, for all the trappings of science fiction joy, is still an FPS at its core. And that core is not what I dig. It’s dying and resetting and figuring out exactly where the enemies are located. It’s repetition and brute memorization. That’s not a game; that’s like learning multiplication tables.</p>
<p><em>Halo 2</em> reminded me of Cecily, the sweet Filipino-American woman I went on a single date with. She was tall and lithe and had delightfully dirty stories; she had a good job and a lovely kid that she showed me a picture of. She also had a dagger-field of topics I couldn’t discuss (politics, music, books, her family, sports, the Philippines) and jokes I couldn’t make, because she liked being the funny person in the room. I probably could have figured out the pattern, but, like <em>Halo 2</em>, I simply couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<h2>II. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, I lived with Jason, a recovering heroin addict. He spent a lot of time on the couch, playing GameCube and often, when leaving or coming home, I’d hang out with him and chain smoke cigarettes. While I’d sometimes play <em>Mario Party</em> with him, mostly I watched him play <em>Metroid Prime</em> and <em>Phantasy Star</em>. I liked him.</p>
<p>He died a few years later of a heroin overdose. I found out later, through friends of friends, because I had moved out of the house as soon as I put all the pieces together. Why our money was disappearing, why his friends were using our bathroom for an hour at a time, why a cop showed up at our early in the morning for no particular reason. This isn’t strictly related, but it feels that way. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> played like I imagined a heroin overdose would feel: slow, stultifying, mind-numbing, a product of poor decisions.</p>
<p>Phantasy Star 0 was half a hundred things warning signs, like platforming and weapon farming and minimal storyline. Warning signs I followed.</p>
<h2>III. <em>Final Fantasy III</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>Another victim of the blocky isometric necessity of the early aughts. What was the fixation with that crap? The load times that were put into the game in order to have these square-headed, lopsided monstrosities. Call me old-fashioned, call me a luddite, but I like my old-school RPGs, well, old school: pixels, cartridge-based, non-existent load times.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that <em>Final Fantasy III</em> is unplayable. I’ll track down a different re-mastered version and play that, one without 45-second load times between every single battle and dungeon. Especially on a portable platform, one that’s meant to be quick and easy.</p>
<h2>IV. <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>(PS3)</h2>
<p>Why didn’t I like <em>Mass Effect 2</em>? Why did I play it for three or four hours, put the controller down and simply never come back to it? I enjoyed the intro and the interface. I was engaged. It even felt like my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Sarah was a doctoral candidate in psychology, she liked <em>Dance, Dance, Dance</em> and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>. She had an adorable cat and a 1950s time capsule for an apartment. All stuff I dig.</p>
<p>After our second date, after we kissed in her doorway, I went away for a week. And then she had a conference. And then with one thing another, three months passed before we spoke again. By that time, she’d started dating her old friends-with-benefits and now they’re married. I&#8217;m happy for them.</p>
<p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was, on the surface, everything I looked for in a video game. But sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes people and places and games slip away, one moment at a time, until, with a look around, there’s a realization that time has moved on and if there was a space, that space has been filled.</p>
<h2>V. <em>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</em> (PS2)</h2>
<p>This was disappointing. <em>Fallout 3</em> was what re-ignited my love of video games in the first place. I knew it was based on the <em>Morrowind </em>engine and modeled around the same open world, quest-based fulcrum that enthralled me. And I love high fantasy, so this was obviously a win-win. But it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Turns out I no longer love high fantasy—not without irony or deviation from norms. I didn’t even make it out of the first town. The spark that drove me in <em>Fallout</em>—the gallows humor and meta-reference—was missing in <em>Morrowind</em>. Without that, it was just a sandbox I didn’t want to play in.</p>
<p>I became friends with this dude Suleiman in my early 20s. We met at a country club where we were both killing time waiting tables. Me, I was waiting to leave for a year in AmeriCorps. He was waiting for his drug dealing career to take off. Of course, I didn’t know that initially. All I knew was that we got along real well, talked about girls and video games and smoked copious amounts of weed after our shift.</p>
<p>Before a shift, Suleiman handed me a vial of cocaine. I asked him why he did that and he said, “Oh, you try it out for free and if you like it, come back to me. That’s how it works,” and it was then I realized he was a proper dealer. And I remembered the times I gave him rides home and he made multiple stops along the way. And I realized there was no way we could be friends. I never told him, though. I just stopped returning his calls and when he asked to get stoned, I was like, “I’m good. I smoked earlier.”</p>
<p>Before I went to AmeriCorps, I heart through the grapevine that Suleiman was hurt I chose to not be his friend. I wondered if I made the wrong decision. Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Last I heard, he was in prison for murder.</p>
<h2>VI. <em>Star Ocean</em> (SNES)</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I would have loved <em>Star Ocean</em> as much as I loved its sequel on the PlayStation The mix of science fiction and fantasy (think the crew of the USS Enterprise goes back in time and is stranded on a world where magic works), the intense leveling system with dozens of skills to master, the combos, the blend of action and classic RPG. The vast world and frequent random encounters along the way to multiple branching paths.</p>
<p><em>Star Ocean</em> was close to what I liked, but it wasn’t enough. Not quite.</p>
<p>I lived at a frat house my junior year of college. I wasn’t in the frat; my roommates pledged and our house became the party house. It was whatever. I liked the free beer and I didn’t mind the parties, either the open campus ones or the smaller ones with the sister-sorority.</p>
<p>One woman and I became very frequent beer pong collaborators, running the table for nights on end. She got her name, &#8220;Moogle,&#8221; for skipping rush one night to play <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. When we discovered our shared love for the franchise, we tried hanging outside of a party, just to get some food. We both could have used new friends, but we realized that outside of video games and beer pong, we had nothing at all to discuss. Nothing. She didn’t read, I didn’t care about football, she liked school and I was there for the extracurriculars. Her major was one thing, mine another. Democrat, Republican.</p>
<p>It was the first experience that, yeah, I might like someone, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to be tight. I’d grown beyond needing just one or two similarities.</p>
<h2>VII. <em>Twisted Metal</em> (PS)</h2>
<p>I played the heck out of <em>Twisted Metal 2</em> in the &#8217;90s. I learned the ins and outs of all the vehicles. I memorized the courses. With one or two exceptions (I never learned to time the dune-buggy’s jumps and playing as a malevolent clown…no), I mastered the game. So, of course I was excited to try the original Twisted Metal.</p>
<p>Except, sometimes originals aren’t as good. The original <em>Mega Man</em> is basically a crappy <em>Mega Man 2</em>, with hints of a good game inside. <em>Twisted Metal</em> could have been a good game if the graphics had been better, the controls smoother, the handling tighter, the cars more differentiated&#8230; if it had been an entirely different game, in other words.</p>
<p>I went out with Keisha twice. The first time I thought I saw some potential, despite her talking on a cell phone for half of dinner. On the second date, when I saw her take out her phone despite, “Oh, I’ll just be a minute,” I realized that, nope, I was right the first time.</p>
<h2>VIII. <em>Metroid</em> (NES)</h2>
<p>I wound up dating this woman for a few months. Amy was a scientist, an artist. She laughed and taught, ran and painted, and liked <em>Guitar Hero</em> and loved travelling. I liked her. I met her dancing and thought, oh shit, this dating thing worked out. I liked her. A lot. Like, a whole lot.</p>
<p>I never got comfortable. I couldn’t relax. She was, to quote <em>High Fidelity</em>, “Out of my class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. What am I? Average.”</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> was like Amy. Too hard, too complicated, too dangerous, too menacing. When health got low, that damned beeping sounded until either I either died or restored my energy. I lived with that beeping for hours on end. I couldn’t figure out the mazes. I couldn’t find the hidden weapons and passages. I couldn’t time the jumps.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, well, I gave up. I couldn’t get out of my head. I second-guessed myself. I stopped trusting my instincts and signals. I took too much damage, jumped around frantic. And then it ended, poorly.</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> ended the same.</p>
<h2>IX. <em>Advance Wars </em>(DS), <em>Marvel Versus Capcom 2 </em>(PlayStation), <em>Civilization 4</em> (PC), many, many others</h2>
<p>Despite my anxiety, occasional depression, and frequent pessimism, I’m actually quite good in social situations. I know how to talk and bullshit; I have a few different degrees; I watch a bunch of movies, read books. I know stuff. I know what to take seriously and when to show irreverence. This is what made me good at dating, romantically or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the summer of ‘07, I went speed dating. Ten-minute dates played to my strengths and hid my weaknesses. I could reuse jokes and anecdotes and appeal to pop culture, surface-level attraction if there was no ready connection. “I don’t live in the basement. I live in the attic, Greg Brady-style,” I may (definitely) have said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I was asked about children. On a normal first date, I may have hemmed and hawed, but speed dating? “I love kids and they love me. The first time they’re bad, I hold up a single finger. The second time, I punch them hard, between the eyes. Third time? There’s never a third time.”</p>
<p>I was quizzed about my hobbies. “None, really. Mostly pot. And macramé.”</p>
<p>Not particularly hilarious humor aside, of the twenty women, I went on a few follow-up dates. None of them were soul mates, but we had fun times. And I remember them well, along with most of my single-serving or two-to-three-dates-over-two-weeks-before-it-fizzled-into-nothing romantic matches. I remember them, not because of regret or because one “got away,” but because, in one way or another, they all clarified exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>On a coffee date with one of the non-soul mates, Sara, a red-haired, zaftig doctor, genuinely surprised me with a casual insight. We were halfway through our coffee (you date enough, you start scheduling coffee instead of food to save on cash) when she sighed, interrupted whatever I had been saying, and said, “You know, you’re not my normal type.”</p>
<p>I sipped, raised an eyebrow and asked for her to continue.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re funny. I don’t like funny guys. And you work in mental health; I like guys who make more money than me. And also, you’re white.” Her fingers tapped the table continually.</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I am white,” I said, lighting a cigarette and keeping my eyes from rolling.</p>
<p>She pounded the rest of her coffee and asked for a refill. “I exclusively date black dudes.”</p>
<p>I exhaled smoke rings and thought for a moment. “So, let me get this straight. You don’t like funny white dudes who are poor.”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“What about artists? Because I’m an aspiring writer, too.”</p>
<p>She sighed, “God, I hate artists.”</p>
<p>I laughed and signaled for a refill too. “Dude, I can’t imagine why you went on this date, then. Because if you aren’t into those qualities, I literally have nothing else.”</p>
<p>She bummed a smoke from me and we inhaled in unison. The check came and we paid. “Well, I don’t know. You have to try new things, right? We get older and we forget to branch out, you know? But sometimes you know you missed. I mean,” she smiled and put out her hand, “you weren’t that into me either, right?”</p>
<p>I refrained from saying anything that would make this conversation more awkward, and just nodded. I ignored the attraction I felt and pushed it down. Because she was right, besides the purely physical pull I felt toward her, I wasn’t that interested in her.</p>
<p>Until then, my 27th year of life, I’d almost always been after the story. It’s why I went speed-dating, why I went to random raves in warehouses, why I always said yes to whatever weird thing my friends wanted to do. Or I said yes to dates because she was hot. Or because it would look good on a resume. Not always because I enjoyed it. In fact, I would often say yes to events I very well knew I would hate. Because I wanted the story of how much I hated it.</p>
<p>And then, just as we were saying goodbye, she said something banal, but that I just hadn’t thought of until that particular moment in time.</p>
<p>She said, “I’m just too old to waste my time when it isn’t working.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This city was once a happy peaceful place,” the opening text scrawl tells us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until one day a powerful secret criminal organization took over. This vicious syndicate soon had control of the government, and even the police force. The city has become a center of violence and crime where no one is safe. Amid this turmoil, a group of determined young police officers has sworn to clean up the city. Among them are Adam Hunter, Axel Stone, and Blaze Fielding. They are willing to risk anything—even their lives—on the streets of rage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love that opening. No further context is needed, no additional story required, which is good cause there isn’t any. Just simply stated. “There are killer bad guys out there. Go beat ’em up in name of law and order or whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took me a long time to appreciate games with fuller, more complex premises. Eventually I got into RPGs and the wealth of storytelling found in them, but it was a slow process. To me, there was just too much going on—I wanted something simple that didn’t require but so much thinking on my end. I just wanted to play a cool-looking hero who felt powerful against the bad guys. I didn’t need to know who the bad guys were—outside of what they looked like—and I didn’t need or want to know their motivations and circumstances, or anything outside their badness. Largely, it was fulfilling the fantasy of getting to be the hero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think most everyone respects the hero image. A hero who’s battle-hardened and standing just as determined at the end as they were at the beginning. A hero who’s fought their way through the night’s trials to finally arrive at a point where all that stands between them and their goal is a door.Behind that door, final showdown. Most everything action oriented thrives on that imagery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroes simplify life, they tell us that no matter what it always comes down to the hero and their nemesis, and no matter how complex the issue—street crime, terrorism, human trafficking—in the end it always turns out there’s one person behind it all. And one person opposing it. That’s comforting, I think, because it makes us believe these ills—be they drugs, crime, or in the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streets of Rage,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> really big guys with boomerangs—can all be cleaned up. Order can be restored, and all it takes is one good person. That’s uniquely American mythology as I’ve experienced. We like thinking there’s a “good cop” who can save us from the “bad guys.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to think that way, but my world is more complex now. I look at things through a more dissecting lens. I’ll put it like this: I love the movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demolition Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the convention is cool—the hero and nemesis are sent through time together to do battle in a distant and strange future. As kid that was about all I focused on, that and the action and the one scene with a naked woman. But now, I see a story about how police brutality saves a future of wimpy virgin intellectuals from a karate ultra thug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what I’ve come to think of as an aging conservative’s snarky vision of a dystopian future, people in the year 2024 are no longer used to conflict. Everyone speaks in needlessly “wordy” language and people are fined for using profanity. No one is used to physical contact, anything considered “bad for you” is illegal, and everyone dresses in a phoney style appropriated from Asian fashion. Oh yeah—no one kisses or fucks anymore either, because that’s gross and diseased—instead they put on VR helmets and spit a lot of techno-babble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police in this world are gentle voiced babysitters whose major duties are enforcing curfews and arresting people who curse too much. So, when an old world convict who’s too violent and dangerous for them escapes, “an old fashioned cop” has to be defrosted to deal with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what’s immediately apparent there is the ultimate contempt for the law. In the movie, Stallone’s character is clearly meant to represent the “right way” of doing things, and he’s a hard-cussing, hard-fighting cop who routinely engages in practices well beyond excessive force. He shoots first and asks questions never and that’s okay because he’s the good guy, protecting the rest of society from the scum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s first introduced during the LA riots—a time of such total lawlessness and mass gangs of conscienceless criminals that on-sight executions and mass destruction of property is deemed totally acceptable and warranted and lauded. This is classic “good guy cop” hero imagery. When he breaks the law, it’s because the law is outmoded, corrupt and intractable, and basically just in the fucking way of what he really needs to do. And we cheer for this, all of us. We root for the cop to stack the body count up and teach those punks a lesson. In the movies and on TV and in our video games, everyone likes “Excessive Force Cop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villain, Snipes, by contrast, is described as “a criminal the likes of which you’ve never seen.” His blatant sadism is remarked upon often. They literally highlight on the screen that he is a rapist. He’s a “superpredator,” to quote Hillary Clinton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s a classic trope too, the bad guy. I mean the really bad guy. No conscience, no remorse, completely irredeemable, guilty of every horrible crime we can think of. Of course he just happens to be black, and, broadly speaking, he’s completely deserving of death. There’s literally no other way to stop him. He’s aided by a mass of similarly evil henchmen, none of whom are important but all of whom also need to die. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minus the conventions, this is every police action flick. Hero cop versus villain and his gang of criminals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those criminals become a group that we deem inhuman and deserving of humiliation, torture, and death. We apply a simplistic black-and-white morality where there’s only two sides and one choice of where to stand. “Draw a line in the sand” cowboy thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That kind of simplification doesn’t describe the real world. In the real world each one of those criminals is a person. Each of those criminals has a life with its own rich cast of characters. Each of those criminals is an individual, not a nameless and insignificant part of a horde of interchangeable faces and clothing—which is how they’re treated in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demolition Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other movies. Which is how they’re treated in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streets of Rage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand character sprites and budgets and timelines and how games work. I also understand that society isn’t a vacuum and media both influences and is influenced by culture. Media both reflects and distorts the reflection of everything society believes. Sometimes that distortion shows the likable shit—superhero movies showcasing the selflessness, tenacity, and unimaginable potential in every person. Sometimes what’s staring back is the ugly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streets of Rage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the entire point is to wade through endless hordes of street punks, all of whom look exactly the same except for sometimes having different colored hair or clothes. The justification for beating them all to death with bare hands, pipes, baseball bats, knives, broken bottles, or even a bazooka is that they’re on the street and attacking the player. But that’s okay, because the characters are fighting back in self-defense and they’re cops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except they’re fucking not, and that’s the fucking point—the character bios clearly state at the beginning that all three characters are ex-cops. Which makes them vigilantes and completely outside the law—criminals themselves. But that’s still okay, because in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streets of Rage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in real life, cops and cop-wannabes are given passes to break the law. They get that pass because people are scared, because people want them to break the law. Because we believe there are “bad guys” out there, “really bad hombres,” as the President-elect put it. And someone’s gotta go get them, take them out, make them pay. Bad guys and everyone like them deserve to die, and it honestly really doesn’t much matter how, is how the thinking goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We Americans believe that because in part of simplistic morality and worldviews that often lack context and perspective. But also, we believe in the whole good guy/bad guy nonsense because people can’t separate fiction from reality. People believe what they see on TV and in the movies and in their video games to be real. Anyone whose parents watch </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law &amp; Order </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Criminal Minds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or any other crime drama knows the tropes: “They’re tracking people’s cell phones to find and murder them,” or, “They put the drugs in sugar packets to trick you and get you hooked.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People, lots of them, believe crime is a monolithic entity. People believe fights look and happen the way they do on TV or in video games. Hell, people believe that sex looks like what they see in porn. People believe in heroes and villains and good versus bad, and in the American zeitgeist, good versus bad often looks like cop versus criminal. People think that’s how the world works. They either forget or don’t understand that media is a distorted reflection, and that the extent of distortion can look like a funhouse mirror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t some rant against “sheeple” or any such bullshit; the fact that people largely can’t separate fact from fantasy isn’t a matter of anyone being at fault. To large degree, it’s a product of  being born into circumstances that don’t allow for anything different. Tens of millions of Americans go their entire lives without witnessing or living through anything violent&#8211;without ever getting into a fight. By definition they have no experience with the reality. They can only understand it through what’s presented to them and what’s presented to them most are the images in popular media. It’s not a matter of fault. That doesn’t mean we aren’t responsible for those images, though, and it certainly doesn’t mean there’s nothing to fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the simplistic belief in bad guys as “bosses” creates a horrifying collective ability to casually hand-wave away a person’s life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we’ve labeled someone, or an entire type of someone’s, “bad guys,” they lose all humanity. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streets of Rage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it looks like being one of the multitudes of faceless NPCs that get killed. In our national dialogue, it sounds like, “Drug dealers are trash, sex workers are disposable.” It sounds like, “The cities are full of crime and gangs and superpredators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve had to deal with the repercussions of that image in our society since I was a kid. Just for looking similar to a “bad guy,” I’ve had the cops called on me, I’ve been arrested in abusive ways, and I’ve had cops pull their guns on me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, intimately, what it’s like to be seen as criminal. Because I am one. I drink and smoke weed in public. I trespass, and tag, and draw, and paint murals on walls without anyone’s permission. I’ve been broke, so broke that my option was “do whatever it takes,” and I have. I’ve gotten in fights and I’ve resisted arrest and I’ve helped raise my best friend’s daughter after he was murdered. I’ve done whatever it took to build a college fund for her, even when I was broke and unemployed. I’ve gotten my masters degree and I’ve written book and I spend my days teaching at the university I attended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not bragging here. I’m posing a question: I’m a criminal—do I deserve to be beat to death or executed on sight?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talk about this often with my students, the difference between looking at a thing and really seeing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say there’s a farmer in a rural area of another country. This farmer sells his daughter to a brothel. Just looking at that situation, the immediate response is to condemn that farmer, think him an evil awful man, a man some would say is deserving of death. But pull back the lens and see that farmer has five kids. They all help with farm work but he’s too poor to feed them. That farmer’s choice is to sell one of his children and use the money to feed the others, or watch them all starve. His actions aren’t excused, but the picture is far less simplistic. And that understanding needs to be applied to all crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even gangs—which tend to hold a special spot in the public conscience as embodying the worst of the worst about crime—exist the same way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I live in the city described in the opening text of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streets of Rage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a city that is notoriously violent and deadly. I live in a city where </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/883366/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corruption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has taken over the police department. I live in a city where most anyone will be quick to tell you that it ain’t a fuckin game out here in these streets. Our nickname is Bodymore, Murderland, and when tourists visit someone inevitably asks if living here is “really like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” We’re famous for the images of rioting, looting criminals. In my city, the </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMzmpdlACvo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crips and Bloods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feed the homeless. In my city, the three largest gangs unite to push community-building programs and take </span><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/freddie-gray-protests-unite-baltimore-gang-members-326503"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nonviolent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stands against police brutality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I’m saying is, and it’s odd that I have to point this out: gang members are people too. Even the scary ones. And there are no masses of interchangeable thugs. And there are no bad guys, and there are no good guys—there’s only people. All of them complicated, all of them meaningful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while I think it’s easy to dismiss pleas for humanity as “soft-heartedness,” at some point we all have to reckon with the arbitrary nature of these distinctions; who’s good and who’s bad and who gets a pass for what crimes. Because the truth is we’re all criminals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all break the law. We speed, we jaywalk, we spit on sidewalks. We download movies and music without paying anything for them. We smoke pot, sneak alcohol into places, lie on our taxes, and piss outside. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all criminals, and people are loathe to admit that because they know how we treat criminals. I understand what it’s like to be looked at as the bad guy all the time. I think most people blindly believe that they’ll never experience being a criminal. Everyone thinks they won’t get caught.  The truth is, it’s in the state’s best interest not to give you a second chance because you are profitable. Private prisons need bodies in the cells to make money and any body will do. If the day comes where it’s your body, you’ll understand what it’s like to be the bad guy too.</span></p>
