								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weight of the controller increases. Playing becomes a Herculean effort. Muscles build in my chubby child hands, muscles I never knew I had, muscles developing from nowhere. I do this exercise in gaming weightlifting because I want to see on the big screen my Pokémon Game Boy games. <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>, specifically. I insert the Transfer Pak into the back of the Nintendo 64 controller. This heavy object serves as an emulator, enabling the two-dimensional goodness, the bland yet still strikingly vibrant colors of <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>, on the TV screen.</p>
<p>Something about the littleness of the Game Boy game blown up onto the TV makes me giddy. This game that is meant to be small, held in hand, framed within a screen the length of a finger, is reconfigured as something large. The square body of the female avatar is so much larger on the screen, where my budding sexuality, my femmeness, imagines in her step a pep, a sway, a femininity celebrated. I put the volume up as much as I remotely can to hear the iconic Pokémon music, each town and location its own score, thinking how lifelike, how grand it is journeying across this 8-bit world. The scale of Pokémon, otherwise tiny, otherwise contained between my two hands, on the big screen becomes something magical.</p>
<p>I spend entire summers playing <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Crystal </em>on the Nintendo 64 on my grandparents’ TV. It’s the only place where I can spend hours upon hours playing because in my home—well, not really my home but the rental, the cramped box we live in without any privacy, any moment to be with oneself—I have to share a TV with my brother, and the living room one is off limits. TV time is hard to come by, but in my grandparents’ house, a house where my abuelita babies me, I can have it for as long as I want. But these are just for the summers, or weekends. On most other days, my Game Boy allows me to clock in the hours upon hours of gameplay I otherwise cannot clock in at my own home. I can be in the backyard, in the woods, sitting on the porch steps. The world of Pokémon anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>In my grandparents’ house, I have a space all my own to game. I recline the chair as I want, I sit as up close as I want, I play as long as I want. I yell at the TV as loud as I need to, I throw the controller onto the couch as hard as I want, I can let my body respond to the games I play as I need it to. Something I cannot fully do in the cramped space of my parents’ house, with my shared bedroom, our shared living room, all the space I must share with so many others.</p>
<p>My grandparents’ living room is the closest thing I get to a gaming room. This kind of space is a luxury. Some of the other boys and girls in my school note how they have a game room, a special room with cool, expensive gaming chairs, the biggest screens and the best surround sound systems, all the latest consoles and equipment. They speak of these luxuries and I stay quiet, little me who comes from the Mexican part of town, the poor part of town, a neighborhood they call ghetto and dirty. They speak of their game rooms and I stay quiet, like always, like I will do for so many years because I idealize these little white children, their well-maintained neighborhoods, their big houses with game rooms. I feel intensely jealous of these boys and girls. Of the fact they have a designated space for gaming and leisure, a space carved out in the home to do what I can only do on special occasions at my grandparents’. A gaming room of their own.</p>
<p>Gaming is a form of solitude for my childhood self. A moment of respite from the antics of my family, a moment of escape from the white boys and girls I go to school with who call me fat, call me faggot, call me a dirty Mexican or a dirty Puerto Rican. That want that is being alone with oneself. We don’t frequently connect childhood with the desire for solitude. Children want to play with others, be with other children, have the attention of adults. Perhaps because I do not have my own room growing up, no space to call my own, and every Monday through Friday I experience a barrage of hatred from my classmates, at an early age I cultivate this need for solitude. A longing for an environment never had. A space in this world sectioned off just for me. For me and only me.</p>
<p>Video games give me this solitude. This being with myself. Though, like reading, this is a solitude that is not really solitude. I spend my time with my Pokémon, battling with them and healing them after, feeding them berries and giving them nicknames. It’s a form of connection, an intimacy with the unreal, a being with the incorporeal. In a world where I feel I don’t matter, where any day I can be gone and no one could care less, video games assure me that, in fact, I do matter, I am needed, my presence is essential. They—my Pokémon, my blue haired avatar, the NPCs, the storyline—need me.</p>
<p>The heaviness of the controller as I play in my grandparents’ house. The focus, the concentration, the joy. The weight in my hands is comfort. The controller’s increased dimensions, its bulkiness, the strain it demands, reminds me I am inside playing the game I often have to play outside. The game I fall in love with because it can be anywhere I take my body to, any exodus I undertake to keep on going. Here in this memory, this memory still so alive, for hours upon hours in this sunlight-soaked living room of my grandparents, screaming at the TV or gripping the controller tightly in frustration, the breeze through the front door and my grandmother cooking her rice and beans in the kitchen, is my gaming room. These memories at the turn of the century, this faraway childhood, my grandparents now gone, the closest I have ever gotten to a gaming room of my own.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In our new monthly column, “Quest Items,” Marcos Gonsalez explores the materiality of video games. Whether it be the experience of button mashing or blowing into cartridge games, using strategy guides and the literary qualities of game manuals, he examines the importance of materiality for how we think about politics, culture, and video games.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Piragüeros selling their shaved ice, older women with their custom-designed hats, the pastelito sellers giving us all that deep-fried deliciousness. These are the typical wares sold on the streets of Washington Heights, this neighborhood I call home. Unlike the rest, one Puerto Rican elder sells cartridge games on the sidewalk. A mass of cartridge games are lined up in rows on a table facing the traffic. On fair-weather days, they are open, unprotected. On days with contrary weather, they are sheathed in clear plastic, the titles still visible. NES, Sega, N64, you name the system and he has it. His shop is located across the street from my apartment, next to my local grocery store, so I pass by him frequently. I watch, and cringe, as the new arrivals to the neighborhood, a neighborhood coined “The New Williamsburg,” ask questions about the games in English as the man fumbles to answer them. Most of the time I stop, look for a minute, then resume purchasing my groceries. One day, out of curiosity, out of a will to just be neighborly, I ask him how he collected this many games. They were my sons’, he replies, and they grew up, grew out of them.</p>
<p>As much as I would like to, I don’t probe any further into this man’s life, into the history of how he amassed his collection. I settle for the smile he gives after he answers. A broad smile, a tooth or two golden capped, a depth and energy in the topmost reaches. He gives one of those smiles we give when there is more to a story, when there is a story, a story not meant for a stranger. I see his boys in the texture of his smile. Boys too macho, too grown to play video games anymore. Boys who to become men decided they no longer did such childish things. Boys who left their cartridge game collection in the apartment of their father, their father who left an island to make it in America, an America where he must sell cartridge games on the sidewalk to make ends meet because the rent spikes keep happening, the price of groceries keeps increasing, the cost of surviving keeps going up and up.</p>
<p>My assessment is unfair. I, too, grew up and left most of my games in my parents’ house. But I want those games, and someday when I have a big enough space will reclaim them. Tucked away in my childhood closet is one box holding a bunch of Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis games. These games, like the Puerto Rican viejo’s games, were not originally mine. They belonged to my brother. Like the Puerto Rican viejo who inherited his cartridge games from his children who no longer wanted them, I inherited mine from a brother who passed away at the age of twenty-one. They became mine when I was twelve because they had nowhere else to go. No one wanted them, much like the games of the Puerto Rican viejo’s children, and no one cared to have them. Relics of a dead and gone age.</p>
<p>Don’t blow that hard into it you knucklehead, my brother would say, snatching the cartridge from my hands. He would blow into it softly, hands gripping the other end gently, telling me like this, like this. So unlike him, all this softness, this boy that is a wrestler-wannabe, this boy built like a linebacker, this boy who acts first and thinks later. He’s everything to me, this boy. This boy who instills in me the love of gaming, the joy the pleasure the thrill of a controller in your hands. He is invulnerable, so I want to believe, like those many boss fights I cannot get past as a child, unbeatable, so I tell myself. I blow into the cartridges, as he would, plugging them into the console with care, as he would do, watching the screen in hopes it will light up, pixelated and alive, ready to be played. An extra life awarded.</p>
<p>For me, this box containing all these cartridge games is priceless. It is my brother. It is him beating me up in <em>WWF: Wrestlemania The Arcade Game</em>, or him guiding me through a <em>Sonic </em>game, or our coordinated combos taking down enemies in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time.</em> If he were still here, he would still be playing video games. His career as a gamer would not have ended with cartridge games, as those of the Puerto Rican viejo’s children did. He could still be a man, be an adult, and play.</p>
<p>The box full of cartridge games is more than nostalgia: it’s living memories.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what those cartridge games are to the Puerto Rican viejo across the street from me. Something more than plastic, something more than just a video game. A trip downtown to the electronics store with his boys in a graffitied subway cart. The sound of an apartment full of life. The controller in his hand on occasion playing with his kids, schooling them and getting schooled by them. Memories in the microchips, dreams fulfilled and unfulfilled in the plastic.</p>
<p>Maybe he wants to sell them because these memories, these material objects tucked away in a closet, are too hard to keep around, too much to bear.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn’t want to be outside there on the sidewalk selling them. Maybe he has no other choice.</p>
<p>Or maybe the story is as simple as him wanting more room in his apartment. More space for him to be with himself, a space he can call his own.</p>
