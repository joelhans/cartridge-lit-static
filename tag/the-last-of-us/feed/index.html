								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asleep with mulch in the hot tariff of summer dawns,<br />
bruised worse than oil, smelling of oleander<br />
&amp; a family of dogs. What was funny when the world existed</p>
<p>still holds: Dr. Oceanfront, Hall of Fame Top 10 Reviewer<br />
is a favorite life of ours to consider. Long after the last Amazon<br />
order went through, is he out there</p>
<p>foraging old stores of food, refilling<br />
his shotgun. Muttering five stars at everything, five stars at<br />
all he sees. Stubborn, crazed, and hopeless alone:</p>
<p>not privileged to the healthy pus of good companionship,<br />
a link to light you. Connexion. Even when we met<br />
some crystalled jockeys, walking koans</p>
<p>(who knows where they found it) it was nice. Just<br />
nice. A moment to appreciate. But they tried us so<br />
I shot one in his eye</p>
<p>then mouth. S templed the other<br />
with a scissored bat. We sat next to their bodies. Warm<br />
&amp; again secure,</p>
<p>we treated ourselves<br />
to language’s great fortnight,</p>
<p>to a can of beans &amp; stories of—<br />
what else could we tell stories of—</p>
<p>of how it was</p>
<p>of who we were</p>
<p>of how we came to be</p>
<p>alone</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>I leave a deep wound.<br />
And between you and me,</p>
<p>nothing should be as crammable<br />
as putty,</p>
<p>but when asked<br />
what I mean to you</p>
<p>you didn’t blink once</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Main Character Disease</strong></p>
<p>“What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets?”<br />
— Dracula, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</p>
<p>My flesh is an inorganic compound,<br />
pixels and rearranged numbers.</p>
<p>An electric baptism: my hardwiring<br />
gutted, pouring out fizzes and hisses.</p>
<p>Secrets champagne out of me<br />
and into ambient binary. Rubber capillaries</p>
<p>spring out like frayed yarn, and, oh<br />
God what a joy to be so exposed</p>
<p>and misunderstood: the tenderest<br />
corners of my kidneys rendered</p>
<p>for your viewing pleasure. Another millenia<br />
of slaying vamps and looting castles.</p>
<p>During pause screens, I shadowbox demons.<br />
During off time, my pantomime murders</p>
<p>do not end. When I die, and I will die,<br />
I am revived from nothing—again—</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Female Character Disease</strong></p>
<p>“Endure and survive.”<br />
— Ellie, The Last of Us</p>
<p>A dream in which I am<br />
a talking lamp</p>
<p>with breasts. Pixelated<br />
and sharp,</p>
<p>when I hug those whom<br />
I’m made to reward,</p>
<p>I leave a deep wound.<br />
And between you and me,</p>
<p>nothing should be as crammable<br />
as putty,</p>
<p>but when asked<br />
what I mean to you</p>
<p>you didn’t blink once;<br />
your nose didn’t wrinkle.</p>
<p>The snow touched everything<br />
but you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Archetypal Villain Disease</strong></p>
<p>“What is better—to be good, or to overcome your nature through great effort?”<br />
— Paarthurnax, Skyrim</p>
<p>What gave me away—the overabundance<br />
of lack,</p>
<p>rusted shackles for teeth,<br />
a scowl like blasting jelly?</p>
<p>My problem is I just think better<br />
with a pixelated cigarette in my mouth.</p>
<p>Knowing you is like sipping<br />
methadone,</p>
<p>a high that ends like the hiccups.<br />
So what if my spine is a big</p>
<p>gummy worm? The god in me knows<br />
no winter, instead my mouth</p>
<p>is a shucked oyster shell in which<br />
you supplant my tongue with a pearly</p>
<p>magnet, this head a cocktail of diseased<br />
chemicals drawn into your polarizing waters.</p>
