<hr />
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit: What games are you playing right now, if any?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Maggie Sullivan</strong>: Right now, I am still playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> on my N64 as I continue to finish my larger project surrounding the game, but on the side, I&#8217;ve been playing<em>Pokemon X</em> on 3DS (another series I grew up with trying to catch them all) and <em>Skyrim: The Elder Scrolls</em> on PS3.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>I have two answers for this question. The first system I every purchased myself was a red Gameboy Pocket (first game = <em>Pokemon Red)</em>. But, to me, a video game system was something you hooked up to your TV and it made a statement to your friends that said, &#8220;Yeah, I have a [insert gaming system here]. Be jealous.&#8221; So, with that in mind, my first &#8220;real&#8221; gaming system would then be my N64 (first game = <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em>), which, I am proud to say, is still in perfect condition sixteen years later (game and original controllers included).</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Care to list your top five games?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>1) The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>(go figure, right?).</p>
<p><em>2) The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#8217;s Mask </em>(again, go figure).</p>
<p><em>3) Pokemon </em>(any from the series, because they just got better as you went, though I will say, I was more partial to the games that had a pokemon following you).</p>
<p><em>4) Skyrim </em>(I get similar feelings playing this game as I do playing Zelda).</p>
<p><em>5) Super Smash Bros. </em>on N64, because it&#8217;s a classic.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>MS: </strong>Honestly, until recently, they didn&#8217;t, and it was simply because I didn&#8217;t really think anyone would want to know my thoughts or feelings about they games they played, though I definitely wanted to write about the games that meant so much to me. It wasn&#8217;t until Fall 2013 when I took a Fragmented Essay course and was introduced to Brian Oliu&#8217;s piece <em>Contra</em>. It brought two things I really loved together in a blissful union: Creative Nonfiction and Games. It was the spark that has led to my all out summer project about Zelda and I have so many more projects on the docket once I get my thesis done. Now, I simply don&#8217;t see myself being able to keep the two separate anymore now that I&#8217;ve gotten started intertwining the parallels I see in games and my own life.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Any tips for how others out there can balance a writer’s life and a gamer’s life?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>MS:</strong> My answer is twofold. One: Don&#8217;t be afraid to geek out about games on the page. That was the main reason I didn&#8217;t write about games sooner (as I mentioned in the last question), but it was also because I didn&#8217;t have anything that remotely resembled what I wanted to do with writing about games. Once I found inspiration, everything bloomed with a natural fervor, so, two: find a piece that makes you incredibly envious and use that as fuel to put your own voice to your favorite game and own it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up next in our contributor Q&amp;A series, we have Brandon Amico, the man behind two poems we published all the way back in August: <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/08/11/2-poems-eve-carnival-gunpowder-mask/" title="2 Poems: “Eve of the Carnival” &#038; “Gunpowder Mask”" target="_blank">&#8220;Eve of the Carnival&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Gunpowder Mask.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Brandon&#8217;s <span>poems have appeared or are forthcoming in</span><i> The Baltimore Review, The Carolina Quarterly, Hayden’s Ferry Review, Hunger Mountain, Phoebe, Tupelo Quarterly</i><span>, and more. He can be found on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/amicob" target="_blank">@amicob</a> and online at </span><a href="http://www.brandonamico.com" target="_blank">www.brandonamico.com</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Cartridge Lit: What games are you playing right now, if any?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brandon Amico: </strong>I’m not, because I’m catching up on all the reading I’m NOT going to be doing when the new <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> comes out in October. I fully expect it to eat the coming season of my life, if not squander any potential poetry career for me entirely. Okay, that’s a lie, I’m about to go download <em>Flower</em> on my brother’s PS3—he’s a hardcore gamer, puts me to shame—because I only got to play it briefly in the past and it was beautiful. <em>[Ed. note: Brandon answered these questions many months ago, and we&#8217;ve only got around to publishing them now, so we&#8217;ll see if we can get an update on how badly Super Smash Bros. has squandered his efforts to be a poet in the last few months.]</em></p>
<p><strong>CL: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA: </strong>We had a Sega Genesis at the house—or as we and I think everyone else called it, just the “Sega”—and my goodness, I was hooked. <em>Sonic 1</em> – Knuckles were favorites, as was <em>Ms. Pac-Man</em>, but we also had some obscure games like <em>Phelios</em> and <em>Mystic Defender</em>. And, given that I was I think around 5 or 6 at the time, we also had those horrific games that children want because of the characters—<em>Aladdin</em>, <em>The Berenstain Bears’ Camping Adventure</em>, <em>Toy Story</em>, <em>Power Rangers</em>—you know, that cardboard-thin, repetitive dreck that we simply could not stop playing. I’d also like to point out that I’m pretty sure <em>Sonic 2</em> scarred me for life in regards to water, and water levels in video games. That part in stage 2, Chemical Plant Zone, where the water is rising and you have to navigate Sonic through a narrow corridor of moving cubes or else drown? Yeah, that feeling of being stranded, a kind of claustrophobia, still visits me when I’m out on a boat or even in other video games—it’s strange, but it’s a very real anxiety I feel when, say, looking out around the waters in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>’s Pinnacle Rock and seeing nothing but murky water in every direction…</p>

<p><strong>CL: Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA:</strong> The Nintendo Entertainment System at my grandparents’ house. While the Genesis was the first system I owned, playing the NES with my siblings/cousins was my first foray into gaming, the first time I touched a game pad. Everything around that system is steeped in nostalgia for me—the NES was in the upstairs bedroom where my mother and aunts grew up, in fact. The floor was wood and creaked through the old house, there were a few posters back from when posters just started being a thing: I distinctly recall one depicting the old New England Patriots logo and another a drawing of a baby seal on a soft blue backdrop (as if nostalgia-riddled memories weren’t already soft enough around the edges).</p>
<p>But the games—they were well equipped over there. <em>Mario/Duck Hunt</em> of course, <em>Mario 3</em> (the best), <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, <em>Blades of Steel</em>, <em>Zelda</em> (the gold cartridge!), and the <em>Tiny Toons</em> games were some of our favorites. I still remember that my Aunt Dawn, the youngest and I’m pretty sure the reason all of those games were there in the first place (as these games predated us), was the only person in our family ever to beat the original <em>Zelda</em>—she even left behind her map of the overworld that came with the game, carefully marked where all the levels and secret burnable bushes and bombable walls were.</p>
<p><strong>CL: Care to list your top five games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA: </strong>Preface: Yes, I’m a total Nintendo nerd. I’ve enjoyed plenty of other, non-Nintendo games, and I know many great ones are being made outside of this one company’s platforms. That said, Nintendo was my first game-love, and given that adult life leaves me limited amounts of time to play games, I choose to spend <em>most</em> of that limited time on Nintendo games. So this list will be skewed in Nintendo’s direction.</p>
<p>1. <em>Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em><br />2. <em>Zelda: Skyward Sword</em><br />3. <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em><br />4. <em>Jet Set Radio</em><br />5. <em>Pokémon Gold/Silver</em></p>
<p>Postface: Okay, I know I’m going to catch some flack for not only putting <em>Majora’s Mask</em> above <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, but not including OoT on here at all—well, send it my way and I’ll debate with you all day. OoT was terrific and paved the way for a ton of great gaming, both Zelda and not—but <em>Majora’s Mask</em> was huge and astounding, and if you ask me it was just like OoT but with a ton <em>more</em>. It was also a way more haunting and beautiful story/concept. (If they had asked me for my top 10, there would be tons more Zelda on here—OoT, <em>Wind Waker</em>, and possibly the new one, <em>Link Between Worlds</em>.)</p>
<p><strong>CL: How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA: </strong>I do think that my gaming life—a huge part of how I spent my time up until high school—did influence my writing, even if it took me awhile to realize that it did have an impact. For one, I am a visually inclined person, and this definitely translates into my poems but was definitely something in my aesthetic that became, how would I say—tweaked?—after being groomed by the visuals and movements and patterns of video games. Additionally, I find myself pulled toward accumulation, saturation, bombast, and overlap, in language as well as image—looking back at my gaming history, it’s no surprise that I was quite so taken with games like the <em>Jet Set Radio</em> series and <em>Okami</em>, both visually striking and gorgeous games.</p>
<p><em>Jet Set Radio</em> still remains a favorite—it is unique, enjoyable, and is positively dripping with style, visually and otherwise. I still listen to the soundtrack. The game was just plain <em>different</em>, and it was so full of positive, bouncing energy—the music was funky and fun, it’s one of the most colorful things that exists in the world, and the objectives and scenes were way out of the ordinary—in many ways the game was just <em>bizarre</em>. I love that about it, and I love that about poetry.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_2.jpg"><img src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_2.jpg" alt="amico_2" width="937" height="702" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-984" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_2.jpg 937w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px" /></a></p>
<p>Also cel-shaded and striking—<em>Okami</em>. Though of course, where Jet Set Radio fed my inner nerd for all things futuristic, skating and tagging in a neon-drenched mega-city to some high-energy beats, <em>Okami</em> spoke to the romantic in me, that part of me that sometimes feels overwhelmed and wants for some life that’s simpler, more in touch with the nature, more interconnected. I think this is the same urge that leads so many writers to depict the American West and the farming life in such romanticized terms (though sometimes to the detriment of authenticity, often becoming a caricature), but again, the difference in this case was that the game is so visually engaging; it was laid out before me in thick, bold strokes of color that it captured more of the essence of one’s yearned-for relation to nature than the actual experience itself. Both <em>Okami</em> and <em>Jet Set</em> also, in two very different ways, fed my interest for Japanese culture and mythology, for their aesthetic and sense of art and human experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_3.png"><img src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_3.png" alt="amico_3" width="927" height="522" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_3.png 927w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_3-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px" /></a></p>
<p>And, of course, <em>Majora’s Mask</em> was huge for me. I never realized the degree with which it embedded in my psyche until replaying the game recently—if there’s a better demonstration of a video game as literature, I don’t know of it. The game is wide, emotionally charged, and <em>dark as hell</em>. Seriously—there are people you can find hidden around the world, especially on the third day (when the giant, terrifyingly-faced moon is about to crash into the town), who are just curled up in a corner and crying and begging the gods not to let them die. The concept of repeating the same three days over and over, where the only meaningful change happens to the protagonist, is both interesting and heart-breaking; you can spend most of those three days trying to reunite two lovers, and see their lovely rediscovery of each other (as they then together wait for death from above a few hours later, natch), only to realize when you spin the clocks back, as you must, they’ll be lost to each other yet again. Come on, that’s freaking beautiful, and painful, like so much literature is. I could go on and on about all the little gems of moments in this game, the overarching themes, &amp;c., but I shall digress.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_4.png"><img src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_4.png" alt="amico_4" width="929" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_4.png 929w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/amico_4-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>CL: Any tips for how others out there can balance a writer’s life and a gamer’s life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA: </strong>Nope, in fact I’d like some myself—my gaming life has nearly been nonexistent since high school, which makes me a little sad. I try to pick up a new game every now and then, but time is generally against my gaming habit.</p>
<p><strong>CL: What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA: </strong>Mark Z. Danielewski’s <em>House of Leaves</em>, which would have to be some bizarre and maddening virtual reality game. But if someone could actually pull that game off, can you imagine how intense and exhilarating an experience that would be? Good luck to the person making it, though.</p>
<p><strong>CL: If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BA:</strong> Virtual reality, as well—it would be the player watching me read poetry and work at a computer for my day job. It would play terribly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s interview is with the talented Sarah Glady, who wrote about Angry Birds and seemingly endless (mindless) conflict in her piece, &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/08/13/look-angry-birds-air/" target="_blank">Look to the Angry Birds of the Air</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sarah&#8217;s <span>work has been featured in </span><em>SpokeWrite</em><span>, </span><em>Rock and Sling</em><span>, and </span><em>Script</em><span>. She can be found on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/gladyface" target="_blank">@gladyface</a>.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit: What games are you playing right now, if any?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarah Glady:</strong><i> </i>This is more in the realm of RPG’s, but a few dear friends and I recently started a campaign through the initial Kickstarter wave for Storium. It’s been such a fun platform that combines of <em>D&amp;D</em>, choose-your-own-adventure books, and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. I’m an unhinged druid named Improbussesa. I’m excited to see how the site grows in the coming year.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>CL: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SG:</strong> I discovered all things electronic and literary around eight, so my first systems bucket holds a really old PC (with <em>Oregon Trail</em>, <em>Mathblaster</em> and <em>Treasure Mountain</em>), a Game Boy color (side note, classmates at eight do not find it charming when you insist they call it a Game Girl), N64, Tamagotchis, and a survival simulation on LaserDisc that I’m pretty sure starred one of the Savage brothers. I loved them all, because they gave me stories and power and cool music, none of which I had a lot of access to on my own in the nineties.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SG:</strong><i> </i>My cousins bought <em>GoldenEye 007</em> the day it came out in 1997, and I remember sitting and watching them play for hours. I’m the oldest kid in my immediate family, but I really wanted an older brother growing up (which apparently, even if you pray for in class at Sunday School, is still a bit of a biological impossibility), so I used to pretend my older cousins were my brothers, and it made me feel like I had some sort of cultural captain to follow. I also felt like as a little kid, I had achieved some new level of greatness since even though they wouldn’t let me join in, I was the only girl allowed to watch them play. I would then go back and show the other girls (except for my friend Amy who was insanely media literate, naturally killer at all things Nintendo, and another captain of culture) how to shoot in <em>Golden Eye</em>, drift in <em>Mario Kart</em>, or find their missing <em>Pokémon</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Care to list your top five games?</em><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SG:</strong> Right now, I’d rank them as <em>Wii Zumba </em>(I’m a sucker for DDR type games), all space game apps, most of the <em>Mario Karts</em> (although I don’t own the Wii U console yet, so I’m frustratingly bad at it), <em>Pokémon Snap</em>, and <em>RollerCoaster Tycoon</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: </em><em>What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SG:</strong> I would love to see a blend of poetry and gaming, but I would want it have to have some sort simultaneous multiple player point of view narrative. Or not. I just saw <em>Interstellar</em> so I keep thinking about how writers other than Dylan Thomas work graphed against time and space. </p>
<p><strong><em>CL: </em><em>If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SG:</strong> I think it would be an online RPG, but set in a Margaret Atwood-type world and players would have to somehow work together to defeat a boss modeled after IT, the giant evil brain in <em>Wrinkle in Time, </em>although the final takedown absolutely cannot be either a literal or figurative nod to unconditional love. We already read/saw <em>The Giver</em>. Also, it would probably be an app and would look like a mix of Tinder and Spaceteam.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit: What games are you playing right now, if any?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong> The only game I’ve played recently is Wipeout on my son’s DS.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>CL: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong><span> </span>My first system was a Colecovision. I loved it. I distinctly remember the feeling that I was communicating with another intelligence by playing, that all my gameplay was being reposited in some main computing brain located in the desert, like the one Richard Pryor builds in Superman III.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</em><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong><span> </span>My brothers and I were given the NES when it was first released. We shared a bedroom, where we sat playing Gumshoe for a week straight, stopping only to sleep and eat. After the first day we turned the volume down on the TV and listened to the La Bamba soundtrack over and over for the rest of that week. My father was in prison around this time and the whole family was catching a lot of bullshit from people in the neighborhood, especially us kids. We retreated into our own world, much of which revolved around video games. As many siblings do, we developed our own peculiar set of words and symbols, the majority of which originated during our time spent gaming. This memory, for me, is a near perfect crystallization of that luxury we so often lack as adults, being able to withdraw into the safety and comfort of family.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Care to list your top five games?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong><em> Gumshoe</em></p>
<p><em>Metroid</em></p>
<p><em>I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</em></p>
<p><em>The Dark Eye</em></p>
<p><em>Tiger Woods PGA Tour</em></p>
<p><strong><em>CL: How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong> In many ways my gaming life has evolved into my writing life. I’ve always enjoyed games where there was some degree of obfuscation of strategy, so the game play becomes almost metaphorical and dreamlike. As a child and young adult playing these types of games gave me the feeling that there was something real at stake aside from mere pride of accomplishment. From as far back as I can remember, I’ve been looking for something transcendent. While it may sound crazy, this is what gaming was to me for a long time. This interest later evolved into some extremely bad behavior, which persisted until my body gave out, at which point I started writing for the same reasons I was once gaming and then screwing my life up: release, looking for answers about myself, about my own stupidity and the apparent belligerence of existence.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: Any tips for how others out there can balance a writer’s life and a gamer’s life?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong> I’m a father of two. I work fifty hours a week on average. I’m also working on two different degrees, one in applied physics and one in cultural studies. I have full-time course loads in both of those programs. Needless to say, I don’t have much of a gaming life right now. I could, however, offer a bit of advice on balancing writing with anything.</p>
<p>Write every chance you get. Write in your head all day. Don’t wait until you have a minute to concentrate. Use everything, good and bad, as a prompt. Some of the greatest art was made under extreme circumstances, so don’t make excuses.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>CL: What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong> Murakami’s work seems ripe for adaptation. I remember someone saying they were adapting one his short stories, but I don’t believe it happened. I read <em>1Q84 </em>recently and would love to see that as a sandbox RPG. On the other end of the spectrum, I think <em>180 Days of Sodom</em>would make a great survival / stealth game.</p>
<p>I also would like to see more games based on poems. Most of Patricia Lockwood&#8217;s poems would make great games. Probably not &#8220;Rape Joke&#8221; but definitely &#8220;See a Furious Waterfall without Water&#8221;. Emily Toder&#8217;s &#8220;Pelicans in Australia&#8221; would make a great 8 bit game. I&#8217;d love to see a beautifully tripped out sandbox RPG revolving around C.A. Conrad&#8217;s work.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL: If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>AT:</strong> I’m a practicing Buddhist. I consider the goals of my life to be to spread love and compassion, to alleviate suffering and to strive for enlightenment. I would like to think a game about me would incorporate these goals.</p>
<p>There’s a great book by a very important teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, called <em>Primordial Essence Manifests</em>. In this book he talks about the dream realm and how we can use that level of existence as a way to effect positive change. He says that by practicing dream yoga we can learn to fly to the heart of the sun in out dreams, and while we’re there we can pray for all sentient beings and our intentions will emanate outward with the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>This would be a great strategy game. Dream yoga entails some wildly intricate visualizations, which we modify based on our results. It creates a sort of feedback loop, in a beautiful way. </p>
<p>My thinking and writing are heavily influenced by my dreams and vice versa. I see my work a way of reifying the dream world. That’s what I’m attempting to do, anyway; create a map to the recreation of the dream inside another person’s mind. My game should reflect this.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s contributor, Berit Ellingsen, wrote &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/07/16/every-thought-every-motion/" title="Every Thought, Every Motion" target="_blank">Every Thought, Every Motion</a>,&#8221; which took us along with a globetrotting special forces operative on a mission that was both functional and existential.</p>
<p>Ellingsen has stories in <em>SmokeLong Quarterly</em>, <em>Unstuck</em>, <em>Birkensnake</em>, among others, and has published both a short story collection, <em>Beneath Liquid Skin</em>, and a novel<i>, </i><em>Une Ville Vide</em>. She can be found <a href="http://beritellingsen.com/" target="_blank">online</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/BeritEllingsen" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><i>Cartridge Lit</i>: What games are you playing right now, if any?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Berit Ellingsen:</strong> I just finished <em>Sniper Elite 3</em>, a third person tactical shooter with stealth and somewhat realistic bullet physics. It&#8217;s set in Africa 1942 where you do missions behind Axis lines. <em>Sniper Elite</em> is probably the biggest sniping game series, but I haven&#8217;t played any of the earlier games. I have, however, played the other sniping game, <em>Ghost Warrior 2</em>, which I enjoyed a lot more because it had much better written characters and dialogue. <em>Sniper Elite 3</em> was horrible in that aspect.</p>
<p>Also, for some reason, sniping games have an aiming help, which is just silly to add after having tried to create bullet physics in the game. To switch this aiming help off, you have to play without almost any other tactical aid, such as radar and health bar. (And stop with the bullet camera, it&#8217;s macabre and unnecessary.) In addition, on the last levels it seemed that stealth, which is what you do in the previous levels, suddenly isn&#8217;t allowed any longer. The world needs more games that allow stealth throughout, not just action games with a half-stealth approach tacked onto it.</p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong> The first system really played games with was Playstation 1. I borrowed a PS1 and some games because the people who owned it didn&#8217;t figure out how the 3D view and controller worked and got bored with it, so I was allowed to borrow it and played parts of <em>The Seventh Guest</em> and <em>Tomb Raider 1</em>.</p>
<p><em>Tomb Raider 1</em> had discovery, adventure, fantastical locations, puzzle-solving, and for the time, beautiful graphics. I had never seen a game like that before and was smitten. Those are still some of the characteristics I like best in a game. Later I got my own PS1 and played through <em>Tomb Raider 1</em> and <em>2</em> and several other games. </p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong><span> </span>Early on in <em>Tomb Raider 1</em> you find a lush, hidden valley deep in the Andes mountains. Suddenly, the game starts playing one of its stings, a short music track to warn you of traps or impending danger. The composer, Nathan McCree, did an awesome job, his music adds a lot to the game. You hear heavy steps, turn the next corner, and there&#8217;s a Tyrannosaurus rex barreling straight at you! It runs much faster than Lara, so you must fight it. The sting lasts exactly so long that when it&#8217;s over, either Lara or the dinosaur is dead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I expected when I heard the sting the first time, but definitely not a dinosaur! I was so surprised, I screamed, totally fumbled the controller, and of course, lost that first encounter. That was a fantastically well made moment, which to me really demonstrated the power of the interactive nature of games.</p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: Care to list your top five games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong><span> </span>1) <em>Splinter Cell: Blacklist</em></p>
<p>Before this spring I hadn&#8217;t played any stealth games. I happened on SCB because I once tested one of the former Ghost Recon games for a review and enjoyed it a lot even though it was not the type of game I used to play. Via <em>Ghost Recon: Future Soldier</em> I happened on some SCB videos and the stealth/silent attacks gameplay looked so fun I decided to try SCB instead. I stumbled my way through the intro thinking this is going to be awful, but once I got into the game, something literally clicked and I enjoyed it so much, the sneaking, the puzzle process of progressing through the maps, the sticking to the shadows, the hiding, luring, confusing, the dark protagonist, the beautiful graphics, the fact that you can play all non-lethal if you want to. It&#8217;s the first game I&#8217;ve enjoyed so much I played it all on the highest difficulty. I will definitely play the next Splinter Cell game when it comes out.</p>
<p>2) <em>Silent Hill 2</em></p>
<p>One of the greatest game narrative of all times. From that incredibly somber start, to the scary setting, to the either horrible or cathartic ending, depending on what you do in the game, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> makes a deep impression. I bought the game with the Playstation 2 and had it sitting on the table for several hours before I dared start it up and play. It was tense, but I loved it! I was alone in the house and playing in the middle of the night because it was summer holiday.  I remember going down a long ramp to a decrepit museum in the game and being so happy because it was so scary AND fun! Before that I hadn&#8217;t taken game narratives seriously, but <em>Silent Hill 2</em> showed that it was possible to tell a moving and mature story with games.</p>
<p>3) <em>Dragon Age Origins</em></p>
<p>The first Bioware game I played. I had heard a lot about Bioware&#8217;s games and DAO turned out to have a solid world, good narrative, awesome characters, and interesting player choices. At the end the player is given a big choice and then gets a finale corresponding with that choice. I loved the hero ending, it really made the whole game for me. The DLC <em>Dragon Age Awakenings</em> was really good too, almost better than parts of DAO.</p>
<p>4) <em>Lord of the Rings Online</em></p>
<p>The first part of this massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMO) is fantastic. You follow the rangers that are assisting the fellowship and other characters in the background in the fight against Sauron and his forces. The setting and the beautiful, expansive landscapes made this game version of <em>LOTR</em> just fantastic. But the recent expansions have been repetitive and the game now looks and plays very outdated. Nevertheless, when the game was new, the community was mostly new players learning to play an MMO together, and that was a great experience.</p>
<p>5) <em>Uncharted 2</em></p>
<p>Just an incredibly well made, beautiful-looking, fun game, from the betrayal at the start to the entanglements in the middle, and the cool ending. One of the most polished and most entertaining games I&#8217;ve played, apart from the fact that you&#8217;re fighting an evil, megalomaniac warlord by killing hundreds of people. Ahh, the contradiction of mainstream game narratives. But since protagonist Nathan Drake is one of the funniest and most well-written game characters around, that contradiction is easily forgotten.</p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong><span> </span>After grad school I realized that there were two things I would keep doing no matter what I worked with or did as a hobby, and that was writing and gaming. For a while I combined the two by writing game reviews and articles about games. That eventually led to writing about science, which is what I do today, apart from writing fiction.</p>
<p>I started writing fiction because while playing MMOs I was trying to create a narrative with the character within the very narrow confines of those games. After a while it got so frustrating being locked inside a game narrative with minimal variation and leeway, I stopped playing and started writing instead. By that time I had been a reader of both fiction and non-fiction for years, but hadn&#8217;t tried my hand at writing fiction. It&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>Some time ago I read up on bullet physics for a novel I was working on. That led me to play <em>Ghost Warrior 2</em>, which turned out to have some very nice gameplay, a decent story and awesome dialogue.</p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: Any tips for how others out there can balance a writer’s life and a gamer’s life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong><span> </span>Always get some writing or reading done before gaming, and write/read more often than you game.</p>
<p>Since my day job also entails writing and text, I find games very good to relax the language processing parts of the brain and to use the visual parts more. I think that&#8217;s part of why I like gaming so much, it&#8217;s a nice balance to writing and it&#8217;s less passive than watching TV or movies, for example. Of course it&#8217;s more passive than crafting, decorating, exercising etc.</p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong><span> </span><em>Invisible Cities</em> by Italo Calvino would be fantastic to see as a game, even more mindblowing than the book itself. Maybe as a series of series of cities or internal states (or both) which the player could explore. But it might also be near impossible to do because of the fragmented structure of the work and the great number of cities described in it.</p>
<p><em>The Magic Mountain</em> (by Thomas Mann), <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> (by Marcel Proust), or even <em>Against Nature</em> (by JK Huysmans) might be easier to adapt to games, as those have a more coherent plot and conflict/yearning. I suspect they would all play as indie games, maybe just point-and-click, or some kind of odd role-playing game with mostly of dialogue or internal monologue. If there were any test of wills, it might be in the form of witty repartee, comeback, or creating intrigues and gossip about the other characters. Maybe with a historically correct duel as the only fighting. That would have been an interesting role-playing game to play.</p>
<p><strong><i>CL</i><i></i>: If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BE:</strong><span> </span>The game of my life would have to be an MMO. But instead of a standard MMO, it would be a meta-biographical game that would emulate the MMOs I&#8217;ve played, all in one big, weird world. One quest line would be what I did in MMOs, other quest lines might belong to the of people I met in the games, or players would be free to just play their own stories. There would be classes and professions, of course, and the option to do what I did in my first and only attempt at playing The Sims; set the character to write novels. There would also, built into the game, be the frustration and waiting that is common in MMOs, and if you&#8217;re following the meta-biographical quest line; grinding, power-leveling, alt&#8217;ing, raiding, gleefully launching yourself from a rocket onto a raid boss, going to the graveyard at night while bored to get scared by creeping zombie arms etc. Maybe some meta-biographical parts would set in our world. It would probably be more than a little weird.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>We return yet again to the Q&amp;A, now with Brent Rydin, the man behind &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/07/21/moonkin/" title="Moonkin" target="_blank">Moonkin</a>,&#8221; our first piece about the ubiquitous </em>World of Warcraft<em>.

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: What games are you playing right now, if any?</strong></p>
<p><b>Brent Rydin</b>: Trying to get back into <em>WoW</em> and <em>Pokémon</em> (maybe <em>Black 2</em> or <em>Y</em>), but it&#8217;s tough finding time with writing, running <em>Wyvern Lit</em>, kicking off <em>Jellyfish Highway Press</em> (with the fantastic Justin Daugherty of this here magazine), and working a nine-hour office job. I just got off of a really badly obsessive <em>Civilization V</em> kick.</p>
<p><strong><em>CL</em>: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong>: That big grey brick of a Game Boy. I still get really emotional when I hear that ding of the word &#8220;Nintendo&#8221; hitting the center of the screen and leading into the <em>Pokémon</em> title music.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>CL</em>: </strong>Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong><span>: </span>I remember being a kid and playing <em>Pokémon Red</em> in bed, under the covers with a flashlight because it was later than I was supposed to be up; my mom eventually took my Game Boy away on weekdays. Sitting on my grandparents&#8217; kitchen floor playing <em>Mario: 6 Golden Coins</em>. I had a pretty substantial Christmas meltdown in &#8217;98 when literally all of my cousins got <em>Ocarina of Time</em> and I didn&#8217;t. One year, I was home from college on winter break and it was the week between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, and I stayed up all night playing <em>World of Warcraft</em> in this upstairs den room at my parents&#8217; house, just in the light of the screen and the lights on the Christmas tree, and it snowed all night and the morning came and it was this completely blanketed world. One time, a few years ago, I was really depressed and was playing this game, <em>Tiny Wings</em>, on my phone on the train on the way to meet my good friend&#8217;s baby for the first time, and I remember thinking it was the only thing in life I was good at. Which, at the time, was probably somewhat true. But then I met this baby, and was hanging out with my friend and his wife and his dad, and it was completely beautiful and I walked home in the late-November sunset and got hot chocolate at Starbucks and thought to myself, Hey, it&#8217;s okay if that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re good at in life right now. We just need to be good to ourselves. Wow, this answer took a weird turn. But, this friend of mine, I was in his wedding, and on the &#8220;Wedding Party&#8221; part of their website, the photo I had was of me and him playing <em>Mortal Kombat III</em> on Genesis on this old, wood-panel TV we used to have. Point is (and I&#8217;m sure anybody who&#8217;s into <em>Cartridge</em> already knows and agrees with this, but), I really think games — for our generation, especially, y&#8217;know, people who are mid-twenties to late-thirties-ish right now — were more formative and play a much bigger and more poignant part in our lives and memories than a lot of people (read: older, no offense to anyone) will or are able to give them credit for.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>CL</em>: </strong>Care to list your top five games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong><span>: </span>In no particular order, <em>Pokémon Red</em>, <em>Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins</em>, <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, <em>Shadows of the Empire</em>, <em>Civilization V</em>.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>CL</em>: </strong>How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong><span>: </span>Not strictly gaming, but game-related: I started writing because I was obsessed with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> comic books, the ones from Archie Comics. I got into those right around when I got into <em>Pokémon</em> and N64 and Star Wars, so it was all really formative in the same way</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>CL</em>: </strong>Any tips for how others out there can balance a writer’s life and a gamer’s life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong><span>: </span>Just let yourself play when you want to play. We need breaks, and I think a lot of games provide another type of brain usage where you&#8217;re relaxing but using your brain at the same time, like this different balance of passive and active thought that not many other activities can provide.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>CL</em>: </strong>What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong><span>: </span>Sandbox of British modernism. I can&#8217;t even handle how much I would love this.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>CL</em>: </strong>If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BR</strong><span>: </span>Twitter. It&#8217;d just be Twitter.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>There aren't enough games with real emotional depth. Of course there are exceptions to that statement, but games that actually make you feel something are few and far between. I think this is especially true if you are a woman. So many games either ignore women's agency or use them as eye candy.</p>

<p><em><strong>Cartridge Lit</strong>: What games are you playing right now, if any?</em></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Hazelton</strong>: I&#8217;ve been playing <em>Child of Light</em>, the <em>Tomb Raider</em> reboot, <em>The Stanley Parable, </em>and <em>Threes</em>. I recently finished the first half of <em>Broken Age</em>, which was fantastic. </p>
<p><em><strong>CL</strong>: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</em></p>
<p><strong>RH</strong>: I first played games on a Commodore 64, my father&#8217;s computer. I liked it very much but wasn&#8217;t passionate. My first &#8220;system&#8221; was a Nintendo. I think I had to save up for it, or at least partially fund it, so it was a big deal when I finally got it. This was back when you could rent games at the video store (and back when there were video stores), so it was a special treat to rent a new game and then stay up late playing it. That was usually reserved for slumber parties. My neighbor down the street had a Sega, and I remember always feeling jealous because the games seemed better.   </p>
<p><em><em><strong>CL</strong>: </em>Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</em></p>
<p><strong>RH</strong>: I played video games with my boyfriends in high-school, so I have very fond memories of solving adventure games together &#8212; <em>Myst, 7th Guest, Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh. </em>And every time I pony up the money for a<em> Final Fantasy </em>game, I&#8217;m trying to recapture that initial wonder I felt at what seemed a fully realized digital world. </p>
<p>But all of these might be surpassed by my memory of playing <em>The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to The Galaxy</em>. It was a text based game, and hilarious (at least to pre-teen me), and required smarts (and patience).</p>
<p><em><em><strong>CL</strong>: </em>Care to list your top five games?</em></p>
<p><strong>RH</strong>: That&#8217;s quite hard. At the very top is <em>Grim Fandango</em>, no question. Best game ever, and I am so happy it&#8217;s going to be re-released and remastered. <em>Beyond Good and Evil.</em> <em>Braid</em> is fantastic, and influenced the poem in your journal. <em>Limbo</em>. <em>Portal</em>. I&#8217;m going to cheat and give you one extra: <em>The Stanley Parable</em>. </p>
<p><em><em><strong>CL</strong>: </em>How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</em></p>
<p><strong>RH</strong>: For me there isn&#8217;t a huge overlap, but that&#8217;s mainly because there aren&#8217;t enough games with real emotional depth. Of course there are exceptions to that statement, but games that actually make you <em>feel</em> something are few and far between. I think this is especially true if you are a woman. So many games either ignore women&#8217;s agency or use them as eye candy, both of which are pretty boring and repetitive scenarios, if not insulting. <em> </em></p>
<p><em><em><strong>CL</strong>: </em>What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</em></p>
<p><strong>RH</strong>: I think Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s <em>Mistborne Trilogy </em>would work quite well as a video game, but it&#8217;s hard to say what genre would best suit. It could easily be an RPG like <em>Mass Effect </em>or a combat heavy game like <em>God of War</em>. </p>
<p>Or you could make <em>Ready Player One</em> into a video game and it would be the most meta game ever.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>For our latest interview in our Writer/Gamer Q&amp;A series, we have Joseph Dante, author of the moody &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/07/02/dark-hour/" title="The Dark Hour">The Dark Hour</a>.&#8221; He is <span>a graduate from Florida International University, and his work has been featured in </span></em>PANK<em><span>, </span></em>Monkeybicycle<em><span>, </span></em>Pear Noir!<em><span>, </span></em>Paste<em><span>, and elsewhere.

<hr />
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit: What games are you playing right now, if any?</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Dante:</strong> I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Bravely Default </em>for the 3DS, a newer JRPG that harkens back to the old. It’s a horrible title for a game, but don’t let that deter you. If you grew up on the <em>Final Fantasy</em> games like I did, you should give it a try.</p>
<p>The other day I was also playing <em>Coming Out Simulator 2014</em>. You can <a href="http://ncase.itch.io/coming-out-simulator-2014">play it now for free</a> right in your web browser. Have a look!</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit: </em>What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante:</strong><span> </span>My first was the NES, but I didn’t really obsess about games until the SNES. The SNES and PS2 are my favorite systems to this day. So many great games!</p>
<p>I recently found out my parents were actually playing video games before I was even born. They&#8217;d play the Intellivision with my uncle on Friday nights. They’ve kept the system all this time too. It’s in their closet somewhere. The controllers have ridiculous dials and look like alien technology.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit: </em>Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante:</strong><span> </span>There are too many! Playing <em>Harvest Moon</em> with my kid sister. Forcing a friend to play <em>Fatal Frame II </em>in the dark on Halloween. Making <em>Monster Rancher</em> monsters with my babysitter. Crying at the end of <em>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</em> and my mom’s subsequent concern.</p>
<p>One particular memory inspired <a href="http://monkeybicycle.net/playing-female/">this story</a> that was published in <em>Monkeybicycle</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit: </em>Care to list your top five games?</em><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante: </strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> – I played this game when it first came out and I was only twelve. I marvel now at how I was able to even get a basic grasp on its mechanics at that age. It was brutal in the beginning, but I persisted! I distinctly remember it being the very first game that treated me like an adult and not like a little moron with a short attention span. Its story covers politics, war, power, greed, deception, betrayal, religion, family, love. It fits the very definition of epic. It’s considered a classic of the genre now for a reason. It’s such a deep, complex game that I’m still learning new things about it.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy IX </em>– Usually people don’t mention this <em>Final Fantasy</em> when listing their favorites. But everything about this one drew me in: the memorable places you travel to, the colorful characters you meet, the fun minigames, the antihero protagonist that isn’t nearly as broody or silent as far as more traditional <em>Final Fantasy</em> protagonists go. The game starts out with a mock play and a thief as one of the actors stealing away a princess that actually wants to be kidnapped. In addition, it has your favorite black mage character of all time: Vivi.</p>
<p><em>Super Mario RPG</em> – I can play this game endlessly. It’s pure fun. The soundtrack is legendary. I dressed up as Geno for Halloween when I was little and no one knew who that was. But I knew, and that’s all that really mattered.</p>
<p><em>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3</em> – I hesitated with this one just because it’s so recent. But I loved it and I imagine I’ll continue to think about it for a long time. It’s a JRPG combined with a simulation of Japanese high school life in which your relationships directly impact your strength in battle. The monsters you summon are manifestations of your psyche. You summon them with a shot to the head. It’s dark and existential. It inspired more than a few poems.</p>
<p><em>Magic Pengel: The Quest for Color </em>– A game in which you draw creatures into the world, bring them to life, and have them fight each other in an arena, not unlike Pokemon. Your imagination is truly the limit in this game. I’ve never actually come across anyone else who knew about this game like I did when I was younger and I think that’s tragic! I have absolutely no talent when it comes to drawing, but my sister and I are both creative people, and we’d spend hours and hours letting our imaginations run wild and having our doodles duke it out with each other.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit: </em>How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante:</strong><span> </span>They grew alongside each other like siblings, maybe even like fraternal twins. I was enthusiastic about both from a young age, although I didn’t identify as a “writer” or a “gamer” until I was a teenager. As a kid, the colorful virtual worlds I inhabited directly influenced my stories (at the time, smudged scribbles in composition notebooks and stapled booklets made out of multicolored construction paper), which is why adventure games and RPGs appealed to me especially. I also really like the more experimental games that have been spreading around the internet and beyond, how game creators are making them more personal and intimate.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit: </em>What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante:</strong><em><span> </span>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</em> by Haruki Murakami. I’d like to see how a designer would create the visuals. A point-and-click adventure maybe? Yes, definitely. I’d love to explore that world and feel the sense of mystery throughout. The bottom of wells and moving through walls. I want to listen to classical music while the protagonist cooks spaghetti.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit: </em>If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante:</strong><span> </span>I wrote about a fictional video game at the very end of <a href="http://sundoglit.com/joseph-dante/">my segmented essay</a> in <em>Sundog Lit</em>. It’s a game about creating identity, how it comes together from the small parts you take from the people around you. You put life and personality into blank slates (the process of writing or making art maybe). I imagine it’d be something like that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Next up on our contributor Q&amp;A series is Kelsie Hahn, the talented writer behind &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/06/04/donkey-kong-country/" title="Donkey Kong Country D’eux">Donkey Kong Country D&#8217;eux</a>,&#8221; which brought us into an aftermath, of sorts, of the troubled relationship between Diddy and Dixie Kong.</em></p>
<p><em>Her fiction has appeared or is forthcoming in </em>Barrelhouse<em>, </em>NANO Fiction<em>, </em>The Southeast Review<em>, </em>matchbook<em>, and others, and her prose chapbook </em>Responsibility<em> is forthcoming from Lit House Press. She can be found <a href="http://kelsiehahn.weebly.com/" target="_blank">online</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/KHahnasaurus" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: What games are you playing right now, if any?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hahn:</strong> I’ve been co-oping <em>War in the North</em> with my husband. <em>Spore Creature</em> is my nightly wind-down game, and I’m occasionally playing <em>Path of Exile</em> online with friends, but my computer struggles a bit keeping up. We play a lot of used games, so I&#8217;m usually a few years behind on releases.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hahn:</strong> My parents bought an Atari when they were newly married, so my older brother and I always had video games around. After NES came out, we were a loyal Nintendo family. I had a love-hate relationship in that I enjoyed the games, but I was a sore loser and always thought I should be better than I was actually performing. That, plus a temper and my brother’s needling, made for a tumultuous combination. </p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit</em></em>:<em> </em>Most nostalgia-laden memory from your video game history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hahn:</strong> Can I say all of college? My roommates and love interests were all big gamers, so a lot of my favorite memories from college center around gaming. Marathoning <em>Ocarina of Time</em> every semester, voice acting the dialogue of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> and <em>Fire Emblem</em>, creating <em>Sim</em> breeding programs. Gaming was a very social event for us, and we just nerded it up.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit</em></em>:<em> </em></strong>Care to list your top five games?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Hahn:</strong> Donkey Kong Country 2</em>, <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, <em>Fable</em>, <em>The Sims 2</em>, <em>EarthBound</em>. Basically all the games I’ve played more than once (or the equivalent of more than once, in the case of <em>The Sims 2</em>). </p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit</em></em>:<em> </em>How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hahn:</strong> Gaming has been a great procrastination tool, of course. But in terms of craft, gaming forces me to think about characterization. What motivates characters, what do they value, and how is that information revealed? Both gamers and readers will feel a similar sense of frustration if a character is doing or saying things that feel contradictory or convenient, in service of a required plot rather than an organic choice. Particularly as I’ve been working on longer works, I want character choices to feel real, believable, and consequential to the story.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit</em></em>:<em> </em>Any tips for how others out there can balance a writer’s life and a gamer’s life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hahn:</strong> It’s no different than balancing writing with anything else, really. Consider your priorities, and then consider what you can steal for your writing from those times when you’re not actually writing.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit</em></em>:<em> </em>What novel would you like to see turned into a game? What genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Hahn:</strong> Pride and Prejudice</em> as a first-person shooter, where the characters call out witty barbs instead of firing bullets. Characters re-spawn by weeping softly in the cloak room.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Cartridge Lit</em></em>:<em> </em>If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hahn:</strong> A quirky RPG. Cute sprites with a morbid sense of humor. A less smart and self-aware version of <em>EarthBound</em>, perhaps.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Justin Brouckaert is up next in our contributor Q&amp;A series—he&#8217;s the man behind &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/07/14/dad-played-tecmo-super-bowl/" title="When my dad &#038; I played Tecmo Super Bowl" target="_blank">When my dad &amp; I played Tecmo Super Bowl</a>,&#8221; a wonderful poem about sons and fathers and, of course, </em>Tecmo Super Bowl<em>!</em></p>
<p><em>Justin is a James Dickey Fellow at the University of South Carolina, where he serves as fiction editor of </em>Yemassee<em>. His work has appeared or is forthcoming in </em>The Rumpus<em>, </em>Passages North<em> and </em>Gigantic Sequins<em>, among others. </em></p>
<p><em>A talented one, Justin. We&#8217;re lucky to have him.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: What was your first video game system? Did you love it or hate it or feel something completely different about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brouckaert: </strong>My first video game system was the NES. That’s probably a bit strange—I was born in 1990, so there were definitely newer systems on the market by the time I was old enough to have my own. But my parents already had an NES, which my dad still liked playing, so that’s what I played, too. I never got into Super Nintendo or Sega, Panasonic or Dreamcast, any of those systems. I’d see my friend playing <em>Sonic</em> or <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and I’d be like, “What the hell is that?” I had no idea. Eventually my parents bought me and sister a PlayStation, but for a good chunk of my childhood I was happy playing games other kids had forgotten long ago.</p>
<p>And I loved it, of course. I don’t think it’s really possible to hate the NES, is it? It frustrated me at times, I’m sure, but there’s something special about those games. If you put me in front of an NES now with Tecmo locked and loaded, you’d still have a difficult time prying me away.</p>
<p><em><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: </strong></em><strong>Most nostalgia-laden memory/memories from your video game history?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brouckaert: </strong>Playing <em>Tecmo</em> with my dad, firing up the Playstation Saturday mornings while everyone else was still in bed, playing <em>Pokemon Yellow</em> with my best friend for so long I couldn’t sleep at night with the music was still ringing in my ears. I could go on and on about playing NCAA football with my roommate my freshman year of college, but we’ve all got those stories. The memories that stick are all just stupid little ones, but I can’t think of those times without missing them, if only just a little.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: </strong>How has your writing life interacted with your gamer life? Has one inspired or influenced the other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brouckaert: </strong>I don’t actually play video games anymore, but in college I played a lot of sports games on XBox 360 with my roommate. I worked hard and put a lot of pressure on myself while I was in school, but every once in a while we’d pick up a case and run NBA 2K or Madden for hours, playing and replaying all the rivalries and mythologies we’d created over the years.</p>
<p>It often felt like slacking off, but I think slacking off is important for a writer. I really don’t have a lot of vices or distractions that interfere with my writing. I don’t watch a lot of movies, and I don’t have cable. I get out every now and then, but I’m not tremendously social. This is a good thing and a bad thing. As much as I love writing, I start to go a little crazy if I don’t do something other than write for days at a time. I get too tightly wound and serious and grumpy as hell. I work myself too hard, get too caught up in the grind, and I don’t leave enough room for relaxation, for <em>not</em> thinking about writing, which is, I think, an essential part of writing. So, especially when I was first starting out, when I was really getting into the idea of living a writer’s life, taking a night off to play video games was actually a really restorative thing. I got to relax, to put my stories on the backburner while I let my mind drift to sports narratives, to myth and legend, shit-talking and fun. I let myself be bad at something instead of striving for perfection all the time, and that was important for me. I sometimes wonder if I wouldn’t have cracked during stressful periods of my college days if I hadn’t had video games with my friend to help me along.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve recognized the role that video games played in my life, I know I can get this sort of relief in different ways, too. I get it from playing sports, even though my body’s breaking down much too quickly for me to be any good anymore. I watch too much professional football and basketball, play with my dog, go for walks with my girlfriend. These are important parts of my life, of course, and not just distractions. But when I’m really caught in a writing binge, I will deny myself even these simple pleasures, and that’s no way to live.</p>
<p> Of course, whenever my old roommate is in town, I’ll allow myself a <em>Madden</em> binge for a day or two, and it’s in those times that I remember how much I miss having video games in my life. It’s not something I’m hugely interested in these days, but every once in a while I get a strong temptation to go back.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>Cartridge Lit</em>: </strong>If someone made a game about your life, what genre would it be? How would it play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brouckaert: </strong>It would be very boring. Probably it would be a sports game, a mix between <em>The Sims</em> and <em>NBA Street</em>. You would start out with a pretty decent player and then slowly the computer would reduce your skill points. First goes the speed and agility, then the athleticism. Strength was never there. Finally you’re just a scrawny grad student with a mediocre mid-range jumper, getting blown out on the B-court every other week. It would be a sad game. You could play for as long as you wanted but you’d only get worse and worse, and then after a while you’d get the option to quit playing and go write a story about anteaters instead.</p>
