								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are convinced Jung is the cobbler<br />
of this desperate fable:</p>
<p>Begin with a crack,<br />
a trigger to a vital.</p>
<p><em>La petite mort</em> is a must to sex<br />
our shadows, the hour between<br />
hours that allows us weapons from<br />
the armor of interrupted adolescence.</p>
<p>A cold sea to continue:<br />
our facets rise like curious merfolk, tattooed<br />
with a doctor scribble—we must have been<br />
young or writing with our left hands. There is<br />
never recognition to our old language, so<br />
we anticipate mythology:</p>
<p>Seiryu, Thoth, Parvati</p>
<p>mine to make,<br />
our earliest idols<br />
as film-glossed infants.</p>
<p>All the tragedy—<br />
of being looped in careens,<br />
salivating at clocks,<br />
while all the coherents sleep—<br />
punches out our masks, the diamonds<br />
turning to reveal the other facets.</p>
<p>We are all in a dormitory<br />
smelling of leftover tea and sweat,<br />
looking at one person</p>
<p>at one angle at one time.</p>
<p>You turn and the slash of opaque portrait is lost,<br />
only a stitching of glints<br />
left in its place.<br />
Persona is too weak<br />
a word for a wheel always spinning<br />
the electric, always mad with tangles that refuse<br />
to blossom like vessels.</p>
<p>When you think it’s come to a full stop<br />
you learn how your friends can claim only one,<br />
but you can fuse.<br />
You think of a wardrobe that is piled<br />
high, most pieces never worn.<br />
Most gone with the seasons.</p>
<p>Apathy is our sworn enemy—<br />
zombies are useless in a corporal turbulence<br />
that demands roots and life between life.</p>
<p>Everyone swallows the question of when.<br />
when the vanishing will appear<br />
when language doesn’t consist of only names<br />
when coffins will fill with the dead<br />
and not the dreaming<br />
when promise is a sunrise without<br />
the toothed threat of another<br />
frozen twilight</p>
<p>Doubt, that perhaps Pavlov’s daughter<br />
is the seamstress here instead:</p>
<p>In the end, we hope for amnesia<br />
for ourselves just as much, if not more,<br />
as memory for our country.</p>
<p>If anything, give us this erasure:<br />
no more clocks<br />
turning us ravenous as the claws<br />
that have come for us<br />
with our thinning hands<br />
turning and throwing.</p>
