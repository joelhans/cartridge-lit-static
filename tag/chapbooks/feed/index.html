								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have just published the winner of the Push [START] to Begin Chapbook Contest, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/tender-glories/" target="_blank"><em>Tender Glories</em> by K. Jane Childs</a>, a collection based on the <em>Quest for Glory</em> series of classic Sierra adventure games. As it is with many video games, there were some delays in the production of this chapbook, but now it&#8217;s out of beta and we&#8217;re so excited to be bringing you this beautiful work. We hope you will read it, enjoy it, celebrate the author, and share it widely.</p>
<p>Those of you with exceptional memories may recall that, when <em>Cartridge Lit</em> announced the contest winner, we also committed to publishing the chapbooks of two runners-up. We are hard at work on those chapbooks (thanks to the continuing efforts of co-founder and master designer, Joel Hans), and we expect to have them ready in the coming months. In the meantime, please visit (or revisit) <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/chapbooks/" target="_blank">our current chapbook catalog</a>, and stay tuned for <em>another</em> announcement, very soon, about the new editors about to join our team.</p>
<p>And keep mashing those tender buttons!</p>
