								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s black and square.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Anything else?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Good.&#8217; Teleporting Man taps the pad with his finger. &#8216;Next. You&#8217;re walking in the desert and you see a child lying on the sand. It is bleeding to death. Do you help the child or find the evil robot that put it there?</p>
<p>&#8216;I find the evil robot that put it there.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;And then what?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I kill it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Good. Okay, let&#8217;s try a little background.&#8217;</p>
<p>Teleporting Man puts the pad down and explains the mission. I am a robot of peace and to achieve peace I must kill. I must contend against the evils of Dr Wily. I must fight the other men, the ones with only one function, the villains, Wood Man, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man. He explains each one in detail, weaknesses and strengths. I don&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s saying this. I know it already. Training Man told me.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m ready.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Because those bubbles can do more damage than you think, way more—&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Teleport.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But if you focus on…wait, I haven&#8217;t finished going through the Instruction Manu—&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Now, teleport. Any level.&#8217; I adjust the metal on what I was told was my arm cannon. &#8216;I&#8217;m ready.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Very well,&#8217; says Teleporting Man, pressing buttons. &#8216;You know best.&#8217;</p>
<p>I wait.</p>
<p>1.24528 seconds later, the black square picture above the red square picture vanishes. So does Teleporting Man and the Teleportation Machine. And the grey walls and the Instruction Manual and—</p>
<p>White light.</p>
<p>Brown ground.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a forest, more 2-D than anything I&#8217;ve ever seen in my [forty-seven minutes of] life. The wooden machines spring out of the ground, leaving no hole, aiming things at me, I don&#8217;t know what.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay. I was warned about this.</p>
<p><em>Everything will try to kill you, incessantly. Don&#8217;t be scared. </em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not scared.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know what scared means.</p>
<p>I push forward, jumping, shooting, jumping, shooting—it&#8217;s weird, the little white dots worked so well in practice, but they don&#8217;t seem to be killing much now.</p>
<p>Leaves slice my cheek. It stings. I expect red, but it doesn&#8217;t come.</p>
<p>The man in the training room told me it wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Training Man.</p>
<p>I guess he was right.</p>
<p>I shoot the thing that sent the leaf.</p>
<p>Six shots and it&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p>I move on, down a ladder and underground into a surprisingly clean cave. A giant metal chicken runs at me, panicked but no real threat. I shoot it three times in the beak. It disappears. Dies? I don&#8217;t know. I guess so. I move on, shooting, jumping, shooting, climbing, until I&#8217;m back in the forest. I try to look sideways between the gaps in the trees, but it seems I don&#8217;t have that function. More running, more shooting, more giant chickens with zero padding. Too easy. Way too eas—</p>
<p>Another leaf.</p>
<p>That sting again, what is it?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>Avoid the leaves, says what I assume is brain matter. Run and shoot, says the suit. I&#8217;m trying, I&#8217;m trying.</p>
<p>The suit ploughs on—no, I plough on—through trees that don&#8217;t sway and ground without slopes or troughs or anything that might tell me that people ever lived in this damn place.</p>
<p>Vertical energy bar in my way. I don&#8217;t—</p>
<p>No, wait, it&#8217;s a door.</p>
<p>It machine guns upwards. I enter. A small passage, no enemies. Another energy bar. It opens. I didn&#8217;t do a thing, just walked near it. Wood Man&#8217;s security is poor. Anyone could walk in. Does Dr Wily know about this?</p>
<p>Energy bar closes: it&#8217;s a trap.</p>
<p>Wood Man drops down without breaking his ankles.</p>
<p>Teleporting Man didn&#8217;t tell me how to beat this guy, but he did say he was evil so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll all work out.</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … … …&#8217; says Wood Man.</p>
<p>I was told not to speak, but I do it anyway. &#8216;What?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … …&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … … … … … … … … … …&#8217; says Wood Man, jumping up to the ceiling and stopping just short of smashing his own head in.</p>
<p>&#8216;I still don&#8217;t understand. What language are you speaking?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … …&#8217;</p>
<p>He throws leaves and shit at me and I take most of it in the face. You won&#8217;t die easy, Training Man told me, but you&#8217;re not invincible either.</p>
<p>I start shooting, numbers over aim, sure my little white dots will make it through that wooden padding. They don&#8217;t. They ricochet off and—</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … …&#8217;</p>
<p>I ignore him and try dodging like I did in the training room twenty-two minutes ago. It worked then, it doesn&#8217;t work now. Half a dozen leaves slice into my side. Beginning to think training was named wrongly. Feeling weak. Don&#8217;t know if Mega Man 1 felt this too, but—</p>
<p>More leaves, more slices, more something that could be pain.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>For the briefest second I see five balls of blue light speeding away from me then…</p>
<p>White light.</p>
<p>Black square.</p>
<p>&#8216;You probably shouldn&#8217;t have started with Wood Man,&#8217; says a voice I recognise.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s black and square.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Huh? Oh right, the picture. Yeah, it&#8217;s black and it&#8217;s square. Okay, let&#8217;s try something a little more doable, shall we?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;How about Bubble Man? His area&#8217;s not that tough, and the guy himself…well, I wouldn&#8217;t call any of these fuckers easy, but if you had to choose one.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You mean I&#8217;m going back in?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Technically, yeah. But instead of trees, you&#8217;ll get ocean.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But, I can&#8217;t swim. Can I?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t matter. Just drop down and walk along the seabed. Suit breathes for you. Ready?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Okay, teleporting.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Will it hurt like last—&#8217;</p>
<p>White light then ground. Unconvincing green stuff that could be moss. Water dropping in the background, way too programmed to be a waterfall. What is this place?</p>
<p>The suit walks along without me.</p>
<p>Giant frogs.</p>
<p>Baby frogs.</p>
<p>Crabs, age unknown.</p>
<p>Just like Wood Man&#8217;s place, everything wants to kill me. Training Man said they would, and that&#8217;s okay because I can shoot them with my little white dots.</p>
<p>But I tried that last time.</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t even crack wood.</p>
<p>God, Wood Man. He&#8217;s here too, I know he is.</p>
<p>I start shooting. I jump when I have too. Last thing I want to do is drop into the water. Don&#8217;t care what that guy says.</p>
<p>Things become replica.</p>
<p>The enemies all have the same face and the same plan.</p>
<p>I shoot a thousand white dots and fall into the blue and it&#8217;s no different than any other place I&#8217;ve known in my fifty three minutes of life, except it&#8217;s slower, it&#8217;s all a little slower, especially when I jump and—</p>
<p>A black knife goes into my skull and takes me back to the black square.</p>
<p>I adjust.</p>
<p>&#8216;Sea urchin, huh?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t remember.&#8217; I touch the top of my head, expecting to find a crater. &#8216;Did I fail?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Fail is a redundant word, my mega friend.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You died, and now you&#8217;re going back.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Back to the sea?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yup.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But what if I hit one of those sea urc—’</p>
<p>White light.</p>
<p>Seabed.</p>
<p>Blue water that doesn&#8217;t move, that doesn&#8217;t even know what moving is.</p>
<p>The suit moves.</p>
<p>The black sea urchins cling to the wall ahead and possibly the ceiling above but I can&#8217;t know for sure because I don&#8217;t have the &#8217;tilt head&#8217; function installed.</p>
<p>If I want to look back, I have to turn my whole body.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s weird. What kind of suit is this?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but it is blue and waterproof so it keeps walking and jumping and shooting until I see that Bubble Man uses the same door installation company as Wood Man.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to go in.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to die.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to feel pain.</p>
<p>The suit does.</p>
<p>Wait…</p>
<p>The energy bars fire up and down and I&#8217;m facing a guy in a green suit. He stands still like Teleporting Man, but also like Wood Man. Inside that suit is Cthulhu. Potentially I could die a thousand different ways.</p>
<p>I conceptualise a deity and pray, even though Training Man told me not to.</p>
<p>This is death number two, and it&#8217;s going to be weird. Painful too? I don&#8217;t know. I vaguely remember someone saying bubbles don&#8217;t hurt like other things do, but right now, nothing seems true. What does real actually mean when water doesn&#8217;t move and sea urchins stab me in the head?</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … … … … …&#8217; says Bubble Man.</p>
<p>No. Not this time, fucker. I fire three quick dots and they all hit. They all hurt. I know they hurt because he does the frozen backwards dance.</p>
<p>I keep shooting, in packs of three.</p>
<p>A web and a bubble hit me in the neck and it&#8217;s just like being slapped by oil. But…it doesn&#8217;t hurt like Wood Man&#8217;s did.</p>
<p>It really doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8216;That all you got, Bubble Bobble?&#8217; I shout, confident, and somehow it travels through the blue all the way to his head. He seems to nod, though he can&#8217;t understand it. If I can&#8217;t understand his bubble shit, he can&#8217;t understand me. That&#8217;s how language works, right?</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … … …,&#8217; he says, floating down into the far corner.</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand you, idiot.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … … … … … …&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re stalling.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … …&#8217; I picture Bible-thick dictionaries and ESL perverts in my head and shoot. I don&#8217;t question where those images came from. There&#8217;s no need.</p>
<p>I shoot some more.</p>
<p>Bubble Man stops moving and looks me dead in the eye. He conveys nothing. His suit, his body convulses then splits into six or eight pieces—six or eight, it&#8217;s too fast to be sure.</p>
<p>I stare.</p>
<p>Dr God Damn Wily, six to eight pieces.</p>
<p>Six to eight pieces.</p>
<p>I feel sick in my throat.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to eat, says a voice that may or may not be Training Man. Dr Wily does, but you don&#8217;t, and that is why you will win.</p>
<p>Win?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even want to play.</p>
<p>The suit does.</p>
<p>It poses, triumphant.</p>
<p>I expect all of Bubble Man&#8217;s workers to rush in and kill me, but they don&#8217;t. I hear music that is neither foreboding nor trance. I look at my chest and remember that I don&#8217;t actually need to breathe.</p>
<p>White light.</p>
<p>Black square.</p>
<p>&#8216;Good job, killer. Now why don&#8217;t we try something a little…harder…a little…hotter perhaps.&#8217;</p>
<p>Teleporting Man is already pushing buttons on the machine.</p>
<p>&#8216;He split into pieces,&#8217; I mutter.</p>
<p>&#8216;Pretty spectacular, huh?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Is that what happens to me?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;When you die? Yeah, something like that. Okay, next up, Heat Man. Hope you&#8217;re not afraid of lava. Or lava-synth.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Wait. He said something—&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Who did?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Bubble Man. Wood Man too. They were talking to me. You didn&#8217;t say they could do that.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Did you understand them?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Good.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But Bubble Man sounded strange…scared maybe…at the end.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Evil doesn&#8217;t feel fear, and neither do you. If they speak again, just imagine they&#8217;re calling you a dickhead. Okay?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;But—&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Teleporting…&#8217;</p>
<p>White light.</p>
<p>Red water.</p>
<p>Ten thousand kelvins and somehow I&#8217;m not sweating a drop.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to do this anymore, but the suit does so I go forward, shooting more metal that wants me dead, jumping over lava that probably isn&#8217;t real lava but is still programmed just enough to kill me. Split me into six or eight pieces like Bubble Man.</p>
<p>Can lava do that?</p>
<p>I blink and the suit has me at the energy bar doors already.</p>
<p>They open.</p>
<p>I go in, my eyes closed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s either a guy with good padding or a guy who throws useless shit. Not much I can do except shoot.</p>
<p>I shoot.</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … … …&#8217; says what I assume is Heat Man.</p>
<p>&#8216;Shut up.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … …&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p>I shoot more dots, each one bouncing off fire and disappearing from programming range.</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … …&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not listening.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … … … … …&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p>The fire continues, hitting me square on.</p>
<p>It stings.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel good.</p>
<p>&#8216;… … … … …&#8217; says Heat Man.</p>
<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t,&#8217; I say, the suit raising my arm to shoot.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t listen.</p>
<p>Things get very hot then very, very cold.</p>
<p>White light.</p>
<p>Black square.</p>
<p>&#8216;That went well.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What happened?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;All the wrong things.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I died again.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Clearly.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t remember dying.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s not something that can be remembered, not really. Can you remember falling asleep last night?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t sleep.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Good point.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I only die.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Well, far as I can tell, you jumped face first into one of his fireballs. I&#8217;m guessing you won&#8217;t do it a second time.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re sending me back to Heat Man?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yup. Same place. Just before his main chamber.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t want to.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You ready?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I want to take a break.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I said I want to take a break.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;A break?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes. I want to take a break. Now.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Ridiculous. Mega Men don&#8217;t take breaks. Nor do they “want” or “not want” anything. What&#8217;s wrong with you? Are you malfunctioning?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Mega Man 1 was never like this.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;He wasn&#8217;t?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;And he died, what, something like seven hundred times.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Seven hundred—&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yeah, seven, eight hundred, maybe even more than that. See, Dr Wily used to be a lot more cautious, made a lot of the villains borderline impossible. That level with the Tina Turner music…man, that was a tough one.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I want a break.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Still?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p>Teleporting Man stares at my 28-pixel face in its 52-pixel suit. He picks up a pad, the same one he used to ask all those weird questions before.</p>
<p>&#8216;What are you doing?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s a hurricane coming to your village. People live in shacks, some of them are going to die. Do you find the robot that made the hurricane or save the people?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You can&#8217;t make a hurricane, that&#8217;s stupid.&#8217;</p>
<p>Teleporting Man looks at the pad then back up again. &#8216;Do you find the robot that made the hurricane or save the people?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;If I do this correctly, can I take a break?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Answer the question.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Okay.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Do you find the robot that made the hurricane or save the people?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I save the people.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You sure?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;One hundred per cent?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p>He puts down the pad. &#8216;Shit.&#8217;</p>
