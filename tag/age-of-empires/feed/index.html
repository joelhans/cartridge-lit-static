								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shigeru Miyamoto Goes Spelunking</strong></p>
<p><em>with a line from an interview<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say you explored caves as a boy,<br />
I think about the abandoned Sears catalogue homes<br />
I grew up with: watching them rot, heavy with secrets.<br />
What I’d give to go in that unreachable place.</p>
<p>Playing Zelda, seeing those doors on-screen<br />
that resided on the other side of a wall—why<br />
are there always so many walls? No matter<br />
how many games I play there are always</p>
<p>impassable places. Disappearing places.<br />
When McKenzie from down the street died<br />
I told my dad I was biking to his house<br />
to explore it &amp; he didn’t stop me. I biked there</p>
<p>but couldn’t go inside: those ripped curtains<br />
in the window, that sign on the back door<br />
with drawing of a gun that read: <em>If you’re here</em><br />
<em>today they&#8217;ll find your body here tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>I biked back home. If I was born a boy,<br />
would I have gone inside? Or were there caves<br />
in Sonobe that you were afraid of, too?<br />
You say that going back home, someone has blocked</p>
<p>the entrances to your caves. Does that stop you<br />
from going inside? I like to think I’ll go inside<br />
the dilapidated houses I see off the side of the road<br />
but instead I take pictures from my car &amp; try</p>
<p>to rebuild them inside me. It’s not the same<br />
as reaching your hand in a river &amp; realizing<br />
you’ve touched a fish but what else can you do<br />
in this <em>paved and partitioned world</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Age of the Empires Two, Age of the Kings: Loading</strong></p>
<p>We were in the age of empires.</p>
<p>We lined up trebuchets next to drag race cars.</p>
<p>We could walk through trees, on top of hospitals, &amp; knew where to swim to catch glitches.</p>
<p>We carried our worlds in our back pockets. They were holy items.</p>
<p>In the dark, we bent over them with flashlights, hoping for one more movement, one more glimpse—</p>
<p>We hovered around the computer, chanting the name of our world like an incantation: <em>Age of the Empires 2, Age of the Kings loading</em>. We loaded the kings into our bodies, invented our empires.</p>
<p>Underneath the stairs, we designed hover cars, theme parks, estates. We started our own businesses. Every Saturday, Aunt Sue made us chocolate milkshakes &amp; spagettios. We lived in a pantry of poptarts &amp; potato chips. We could be anything.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, we traded mythologies, &amp; there were no books to verify anything different. We told stories &amp; stories about the fish we caught, the men we shot, the civilizations we built in the back of the woods.</p>
<p>Once, we started digging a tunnel he said would go to the Annapolis mall. Every Saturday I dug while he drew &amp; I believed him, I believed him until one week I came over &amp; the tunnel was covered with a tarp. Uncle Tom said it got infested with rats &amp; we never dug much after that.</p>
