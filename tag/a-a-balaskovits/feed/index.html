								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;d like to take a moment to officially welcome A.A. Balaskovits, who we are bringing on as the third editor of <em>Cartridge Lit</em>. She will be helming up new social media initiatives, reading submissions, doing the kind of outreach we haven&#8217;t even thought of before, and generally keeping the airship afloat with her supreme delegation skills. We couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled to have her.</p>
<p>(And, yes, we know there&#8217;s only three of us still, but the gif was too good to pass up.)</p>
<p><em>Cartridge Lit</em> has been around for two years—in that time, we&#8217;ve published a huge catalog of stories, poems, and essays, many of which arrived in the two issues we&#8217;ve put together thus far (with another coming <em>very</em> soon). We&#8217;ve published two chapbooks we&#8217;re incredibly proud of, held a chapbook contest, and have <em>three</em> <em>more</em> chapbooks planned for 2016. We think we&#8217;ve come a long way in the two years we&#8217;ve been around. But, back in late 2015, we (as in Justin and Joel) started to feel as though <em>Cartridge Lit</em> could do so much more. We have a good audience, but the gaming community is absolutely <em>massive</em>, and we think they could find a huge amount of value in what we do—if only they knew we existed.</p>
<p>We started a search for someone with specific skills and ideas relating to social media, and got some remarkable candidates. These kinds of choices are never easy, but A.A. had a combination of skills that we think fit well with the current dynamic: she has deep experience in social media from her time with <em>The Missouri Review</em>, and understands better than we do how to publicize the journal, both on Twitter and via the wider game journalism community. She&#8217;s an incredible writer, a gamer through and through, and she loves <em>EarthBound</em> (again, hence the gif), which is always a good thing.</p>
<p>We wanted to give A.A. a space to introduce herself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey! I&#8217;m beyond excited to work with Joel and Justin on Cartridge Lit. This is a magazine I&#8217;ve admired for awhile, so being on staff feels as exciting as that moment when Crono kicks it in <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and you can finally have the far superior Lucca lead the party. Also, belated spoiler alert.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a gamer since I could hold a controller and an avid fan of VG fanfiction, so send your words over! I&#8217;m really stoked to read them.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for the more professional biography:</p>
<blockquote><p>A.A. Balaskovits lives in South Carolina with three cats. She is the author of <em>Magic for Unlucky Girls</em> (SFWP, 2017), which won the grand prize at the Santa Fe Writers Program in 2015. Her work appears in <em>The Southeast Review</em>, <em>Wigleaf</em>, <em>Gargoyle</em>, <em>The Madison Review</em>, <em>Booth</em> and many others. She&#8217;d love to read your SNES RPG inspired work.</p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, <em>Cartridge Lit</em> is about to become a cooler and more dynamic place than it&#8217;s ever been. In celebration of that, let&#8217;s all give A.A. the welcome she deserves: <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@AABalaskovits">tweet her</a> with some well-deserved congratulations!</p>
