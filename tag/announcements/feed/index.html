								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past month, we were humbled to receive a number of passionate, impressive applications to join the <em>Cartridge Lit</em> team. Now, we&#8217;re excited to announce the journal&#8217;s two newest editors: Phil Spotswood and J. Bowers. Both of them have demonstrated a wealth of knowledge and experience in both the literary and gaming spheres, and they come as welcome additions that will invaluably help to grow and improve our little journal.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to give the new editors a chance to say hello in their own words. First, here&#8217;s a greeting from Phil:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi folks! I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled to be joining Will, Alison, and Jess on the <em>Cartridge Lit</em> crew. With indie games flourishing, there can never be enough artists exploring these virtual worlds and the creative potential within them. I&#8217;m excited to help provide a platform for that.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t stopped playing Darkest Dungeon since its release last year. Though brutal, it has moments of hope: <em>Alone in the woods or tunnels, survival is the same. Prepare, persist, and overcome.</em> I&#8217;m looking forward to reading your take on video games that help us think and act through our toughest moments. Or, more succinctly in the words of Shovel Knight: Steel thy shovel!</p></blockquote>
<p>And, on a slightly more formal note, here&#8217;s Phil&#8217;s bio:</p>
<blockquote><p>Phil Spotswood is an MFA Poetry candidate at LSU, where he also serves as the managing editor of <em>New Delta Review</em>. His work can be found in <em>TAGVVERK</em>, <em>Hobart</em>, <em>Heavy Feather Review</em>, <em>Sundog Lit</em>, and elsewhere. He tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/queermicrobiome" target="_blank">@queermicrobiome</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, here&#8217;s an introductory note from J. Bowers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Greetings, Cartridge literati. I love this journal and am excited to support it in a more official capacity. I grew up playing Dig-Dug and Frogger at my chainsmoking grandma&#8217;s knee, but I&#8217;ve rarely met a turn-based RPG I didn&#8217;t like. I fixate on weird things about games, like Taloon&#8217;s wife giving him Lunch each day in Dragon Quest IV, which you can heartlessly make her sell in the family item shop for 7G. I believe Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is criminally underrated. I wonder how long the potato chips in Rapture have been there. I love video game history, half-remembered DOS abandonware, and urban legends about hypnotic arcade cabinets. Would you kindly send me work that takes on a point-of-view other than a game&#8217;s player or protagonist, and/or anything else wild and wonderful you come up with?</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, here&#8217;s her bio:</p>
<blockquote><p>J. Bowers is a fiction writer based out of St. Louis, Missouri, where she is an Assistant Professor of English at Maryville University. Her short stories have appeared in <em>The Indiana Review</em>, <em>StoryQuarterly</em>, <em>Redivider</em>, <em>The Portland Review</em>, and other journals, in addition to being anthologized by Ashland Creek Press, Sundress Publications, and Zoomorphic. A gamer for as long as she can remember, some of her earliest memories involve the family Atari 2600, Colecovision, and TI-99/4A. Her favorite video game series include Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Monkey Island, King&#8217;s Quest, Quest for Glory, all Bioware RPGs, Harvest Moon, Earthbound, and the Sims franchise. When not writing, teaching, or playing video games, she can be found riding her horse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that you know who they are, why don&#8217;t you give them something to read? Hop over to our <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/submissions/" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a> and send us your video game lit. And again, congratulations and welcome aboard to our two new party members!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have just published the winner of the Push [START] to Begin Chapbook Contest, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/tender-glories/" target="_blank"><em>Tender Glories</em> by K. Jane Childs</a>, a collection based on the <em>Quest for Glory</em> series of classic Sierra adventure games. As it is with many video games, there were some delays in the production of this chapbook, but now it&#8217;s out of beta and we&#8217;re so excited to be bringing you this beautiful work. We hope you will read it, enjoy it, celebrate the author, and share it widely.</p>
<p>Those of you with exceptional memories may recall that, when <em>Cartridge Lit</em> announced the contest winner, we also committed to publishing the chapbooks of two runners-up. We are hard at work on those chapbooks (thanks to the continuing efforts of co-founder and master designer, Joel Hans), and we expect to have them ready in the coming months. In the meantime, please visit (or revisit) <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/chapbooks/" target="_blank">our current chapbook catalog</a>, and stay tuned for <em>another</em> announcement, very soon, about the new editors about to join our team.</p>
<p>And keep mashing those tender buttons!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may have heard the sad tidings, Joel and Justin are leaving <em>Cartridge Lit</em>. Words cannot express how much we are going to miss them. When we heard the news, we rolled up like Isaac and wept on the floor. Now we&#8217;ve picked ourselves up, and we&#8217;re excited to continue their great work in this, the journal&#8217;s next gen. But not without looking to expand our team.</p>
<p>We are calling for applications to join our small but scrappy party. <em>Cartridge Lit</em> is unique among literary journals as we strive to share with you the best video game literature out there, and the more eyes we have looking at the lit the better our chances of accomplishing that goal. Right now, we are searching for one or two people to join as readers for submissions, as well as any additional value you can add: social media initiatives, website curation, the best guide for driving the Mako in Mass Effect (so frustrating!), reaching new readers, or any other plans. We&#8217;re as open as any door in <em>Morrowind</em> once you get the skeleton key.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested—and we hope you are—we&#8217;ll be taking applications at cartridgelit@gmail.com. Give it the following subject line: &#8220;Editor Application: [YOUR NAME].&#8221; In the body of that email, in whatever form works best for you, give us the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name. Bio. Links to representative social media.</p>
<p>2. Brief summary of your history of working at a lit mag. (It&#8217;s not necessary to have this experience, but we&#8217;d love to know if you do.)</p>
<p>3. Why would you like to work with us? What work would you like to do for the journal? What can we do to improve? What would you like to see us do in the future?</p>
<p>4. Your favorite video games and why you like them.</p>
<p>We apologize in advance that this is not a paid position. We&#8217;d love to pay you, but like most journals, we&#8217;re doing this for the love of the words. The deadline is Feb. 1st. We will make our decisions shortly after that.</p>
<p>Happy gaming!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when we first created </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we wanted to start a literary journal that was pretty free of fuss. Just a place where we could get together and celebrate video games and the many ways that they did and continue to inspire our creative lives.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> definitely delivered in that regard. For more than two years, we did our best to publish new, exciting work from dozens of incredible contributors. We tried out publishing weekly, and then transitioned to issues to better accommodate our schedules, which continued to get busier and more complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting about a year ago, we started to feel that we wouldn’t be able to continue committing the amount of time, dedication, and love necessary to keep </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going strong. We brought Alison (A.A.) Balaskovits onboard to help out with our social media and lend her eye toward submissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even then, our lives got more complicated, and our passions drifted to other projects. We’ve finally decided it was time to move on, but we didn’t want to close the journal down, even if we kept the site up indefinitely. We still believe there&#8217;s so much good video game literature yet to be published.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that we’re happily leaving </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the smart and steady hands of Alison and William Hoffacker. Together, maybe with some others, they&#8217;ll be leading the next era of the <em>Cartridge Lit</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not completely disappearing—we have chapbooks to finish up and publish, and we’ll be around to help make the transition as smooth as possible. Most importantly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will continue its mission of legitimizing video games, and literature about video games, as genuine art. We hope you’ll stick around, continue reading, submit some of your work, and give Alison and William their best as they take on this new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for us, maybe we’ll take this time to finally write some of the video game writing we’ve been dreaming about for years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With love,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin &amp; Joel</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;d like to take a moment to officially welcome A.A. Balaskovits, who we are bringing on as the third editor of <em>Cartridge Lit</em>. She will be helming up new social media initiatives, reading submissions, doing the kind of outreach we haven&#8217;t even thought of before, and generally keeping the airship afloat with her supreme delegation skills. We couldn&#8217;t be more thrilled to have her.</p>
<p>(And, yes, we know there&#8217;s only three of us still, but the gif was too good to pass up.)</p>
<p><em>Cartridge Lit</em> has been around for two years—in that time, we&#8217;ve published a huge catalog of stories, poems, and essays, many of which arrived in the two issues we&#8217;ve put together thus far (with another coming <em>very</em> soon). We&#8217;ve published two chapbooks we&#8217;re incredibly proud of, held a chapbook contest, and have <em>three</em> <em>more</em> chapbooks planned for 2016. We think we&#8217;ve come a long way in the two years we&#8217;ve been around. But, back in late 2015, we (as in Justin and Joel) started to feel as though <em>Cartridge Lit</em> could do so much more. We have a good audience, but the gaming community is absolutely <em>massive</em>, and we think they could find a huge amount of value in what we do—if only they knew we existed.</p>
<p>We started a search for someone with specific skills and ideas relating to social media, and got some remarkable candidates. These kinds of choices are never easy, but A.A. had a combination of skills that we think fit well with the current dynamic: she has deep experience in social media from her time with <em>The Missouri Review</em>, and understands better than we do how to publicize the journal, both on Twitter and via the wider game journalism community. She&#8217;s an incredible writer, a gamer through and through, and she loves <em>EarthBound</em> (again, hence the gif), which is always a good thing.</p>
<p>We wanted to give A.A. a space to introduce herself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey! I&#8217;m beyond excited to work with Joel and Justin on Cartridge Lit. This is a magazine I&#8217;ve admired for awhile, so being on staff feels as exciting as that moment when Crono kicks it in <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and you can finally have the far superior Lucca lead the party. Also, belated spoiler alert.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a gamer since I could hold a controller and an avid fan of VG fanfiction, so send your words over! I&#8217;m really stoked to read them.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for the more professional biography:</p>
<blockquote><p>A.A. Balaskovits lives in South Carolina with three cats. She is the author of <em>Magic for Unlucky Girls</em> (SFWP, 2017), which won the grand prize at the Santa Fe Writers Program in 2015. Her work appears in <em>The Southeast Review</em>, <em>Wigleaf</em>, <em>Gargoyle</em>, <em>The Madison Review</em>, <em>Booth</em> and many others. She&#8217;d love to read your SNES RPG inspired work.</p></blockquote>
<p>All in all, <em>Cartridge Lit</em> is about to become a cooler and more dynamic place than it&#8217;s ever been. In celebration of that, let&#8217;s all give A.A. the welcome she deserves: <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=@AABalaskovits">tweet her</a> with some well-deserved congratulations!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We&#8217;re now closed for applications. Thanks to the applicants for their interest!</strong></p>
<p>As we near 2016, we&#8217;re starting to think about what we could do better, and how much more we could get done, if we had more brains involved in the creation of this <em>Cartridge Lit</em>. As a two-person organization, we feel like we&#8217;ve accomplished a great deal in carving out this strange little place of video game literature, but we&#8217;re still looking forward. Indeed, we&#8217;re looking for someone else to hop onboard the airship.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking specifically for someone who can put in work on our social media outlets (Twitter primarily right now, followed by Facebook)—we would like to create a presence that more consistently tweeting/posting links to various video game-related pieces that appear online, and engage both readers and other literary journals/standard video game publications as methods of outreach. Maybe there&#8217;s more we can do, too—Instagram? Snapchat? Who knows—all we understand it Twitter.</p>
<p>This position would also mean reading submissions on Submittable, and having an editorial voice in the work <em>Cartridge Lit</em> continues to publish in 2016 and beyond. There&#8217;s also a capacity to roll out new projects/initiatives, so if you have ideas about those, you&#8217;ll be able to work to make those happen. A printed chapbook to sell at AWP? Merchandise? Curating a series of author interviews? We&#8217;re open to it all.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want this to feel like applying for a job, but we do need to know a little bit about you! So, fire up a new email and address it to <a href="mailto:cartridgelit@gmail.com">cartridgelit@gmail.com</a>. Give it the following subject line: <strong>[Editor application][YOUR NAME]</strong>. In the body of that email, in whatever form works best for you, give us the following information:</p>
<p>1. Your name + standard author bio + a few social media usernames (this <em>is</em> a social media-heavy position, after all).</p>
<p>2. Any history of working with literary magazines, reading submissions, or editing (either selecting, or proofreading) creative work.</p>
<p>3. Your experience with social media—what platforms have you used, and in what capacities (personal/professional/etc)? In a paragraph, tell us two things, 1) what we could do better with our social media, and 2) what you would do, specifically, to make that presence stronger.</p>
<p>4. A brief (200 words, maybe) explanation as to why you&#8217;re interested in working with <em>Cartridge Lit</em>, both in social media and editorial contexts.</p>
<p>5. A few favorite video games, and brief explanations as to why. Don&#8217;t worry, this one is more out of curiosity, not for the sake of judgment.</p>
<p>This work can be done from anywhere, so location is not an issue. Also, to be clear: <em>this work is unpaid</em>—we do this out of love, not for money. Deadline for applications is <strong>January 31, 2016</strong>. We&#8217;ll make our decision shortly after that.</p>

For longer work, or work that doesn’t necessarily fit into these categories, feel free to query first to cartridgelit@gmail.com.</p>
<p>The winner will receive publication in the form of a digital chapbook (see our previous chapbooks as examples) and a cash prize of $150, along with 100% of the donations given by readers.</p>
