<p><em>Kim Stoll lives in Tucson, Arizona. She holds a BA in creative writing from Susquehanna University and an MFA in poetry from the University of Arizona. Her chapbook,&nbsp;</em>Anna Lives<em>, is available from Dancing Girl Press, and you can read her work online at&nbsp;</em>ILK<em>,&nbsp;</em>Birdfeast<em>,&nbsp;</em>Cloud Rodeo<em>, and&nbsp;</em>Alice Blue Review<em>.</em></p>



<p><em>Her&nbsp;essay,&nbsp;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2018/10/01/dead-or-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Alive,&quot; (opens in a new tab)">&#8220;Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Alive,&#8221;</a> appeared in&nbsp;our &nbsp;</em>Bug/Feature<em>&nbsp;Temple&nbsp;Issue. </em></p>



<p><em>Below,&nbsp;she&nbsp;talks&nbsp;with&nbsp;editor&nbsp;William&nbsp;Hoffacker&nbsp;about&nbsp;dissociation,&nbsp;poetry,&nbsp;rituals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;more.</em></p>



<p><strong>WH: How did your essay </strong>&#8220;<strong>Dead or Alive</strong>&#8220;<strong> start to take shape for you? Why did you choose to write about this video game and that particular moment in your life?</strong></p>



<p>KS: The easy answer is that one of the editors off-handedly suggested I submit something to <em>Cartridge Lit</em> and I thought to myself, “Do I have anything to say about video games?” I thought through my childhood and different games that had significance to me, and DOA was the first I thought of and the one that had the most story to unpack around it.</p>



<p>The death of my grandfather was a really significant loss in my life. At the time I wrote this essay, I had been seeing a trauma therapist, so I think I was especially in the mindset to unwrap this particular event and my response to it. I knew that disconnecting, going blank and leaving my body was a thing that I did as a coping mechanism all through my life, but before therapy I didn’t know there was a word for it and I also didn’t know how to control it.</p>



<p>So, there was this really intense, important event in my life that I just totally dissociated from and there was this video game that sort of helped me do that. I think this was something I was just ready to get into and try to unpack and the way I do that is through writing. Also, the built-in metaphor of the game title alone, <em>Dead or Alive</em>… It writes itself.</p>



<p><strong>Prior to this piece, all of your published work has been poetry. What lessons have you learned from writing poetry that serve you well as an essayist (or a prose writer in general)?</strong></p>



<p>I think my work in poetry has afforded me way more freedom in my prose writing. Poetry taught me how to just make leaps, to move on quickly. And to be terse and economical with language. To just trust readers way more. Poetry doesn’t hold your hand and explain things, and I think that can be really freeing when you write prose and you don’t feel obligated to the reader in the same way. Also, there’s the obvious stuff poetry teaches you like distilling moments into a single image, relying on imagery and metaphor, and finding pleasure in the rhythm and sonic quality of a sentence, that kind of stuff.</p>



<p><strong>What are the leading obsessions in your writing? What themes or subjects do you return to most often?</strong></p>



<p>Well, I think I earned myself the reputation of being the “dead animal girl” in my undergrad writing workshops, and it’s not untrue. I’ve written a lot about the natural world and people’s relationship to wildness &amp; wilderness. I grew up in a hunting family and return to that world a lot in my writing. I also like spooky shit. I like blood and guts in my poems. I like the idea of sound as a type of violence. Despite living in the desert, I’m obsessed with frozen landscapes, cold brutal places.</p>



<p>I guess at the heart of it all though, it’s all circling types of violence and trauma. So, even though this essay isn’t about my usual subjects it’s still in that thread.</p>



<p><strong>In 2018 you began writing seasonal Divinations on <a href="https://www.kimstoll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="your web site (opens in a new tab)">your web site</a>, in which you describe throwing bones, gathering with a coven, and other witchy things. Please describe how, when, and why you began engaging in these neo-pagan rituals (if I may call them that). What is their appeal for you?</strong></p>



<p>Wow, well. This one is complicated. I don’t want to bore readers with an essay on Why I’m a Witch Now. But, here are a few thoughts about this (sorry if it gets long!):</p>



<p>&gt;One simple answer is that I started posting these divinations as a way to force myself to write a non-work-related thing to completion at least once a season. It’s generative. I also wanted to practice divination methods and, again, this commitment of posting to my website forced me to stick with it.</p>



<p>&gt;Another factor is that in the current state of the world, I often feel totally powerless, and have these deep feelings of anger and terror and confusion. Witchy-stuff is a way to sort of deal with those feelings. There’s a reason all these witchy, “woo woo” things are having a moment right now in our culture. I think it helps people feel in control, or helps give them answers, or helps connect them with the earth or plants or the stars or the physical world around us or to something spiritual. A lot of the practices at their core are about taking time to actually be in the present moment, to slow your thoughts and focus your intentions. It’s about mindfulness. Divination in particular I think can be a type of self-therapy, it’s a vehicle through which to understand a situation and talk your way through a problem.</p>



<p>&gt;In terms of spirituality, I guess I’d say I’m an animist, though that’s not really a set of beliefs as it is just a way of being in the world. Anyway, all this witch stuff is connected to that. For those interested, I’d suggest reading the academic essay “The animal versus the social: rethinking individual and community in Western cosmology” by Priscilla Stuckey. It’s really interesting and has to do with the stories we tell ourselves, the mythologies and philosophies that have shaped our current western culture and given the state of climate change and “how things are going,” maybe there are alternative ways we could engage with the world? Maybe trying to connect to the wisdom and power of the natural world isn’t so silly? &nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;For several years, I’ve been fixated with the idea of becoming an old and powerful crone. It’s just a vibe I want to have and an aesthetic I really appreciate. I even insisted on playing a old crone in my DnD group. I guess at some point I was like, wait I can actually do that, it doesn’t have to just be a fantasy, I can hang weird plants around my house, I can make potions in a cauldron, I can curse people!</p>



<p>&gt;I took a workshop with CA Conrad on the occult and rituals, and they basically made me a witch. (I hope this gets back to them). If you’re not familiar with CA’s work you should definitely check it out. But they have these (Soma)tic Poetry Rituals, and I learned that through ritual you can kind of stop yourself from dissociating and be really present in yourself and in your writing. So, yes, this witch stuff does connect back to my <em>DOA</em>&nbsp;essay in a tangential way.</p>



<p>Also, CA talked about lion’s mane mushrooms, and though you can buy it in capsule form, you can’t find the actual mushrooms for sale in a grocery store and we don’t live in a place where you can wild harvest it, so I decided to grow it in my house and briefly got really into mushroom growing. And my house felt really witchy and weird and I was like “I’m into this. I dig this. Let’s see where this takes me.”</p>



<p>&gt;It’s fun! It’s fun to gather with friends and make stuff like candles or tinctures or wreaths or whatever and eat a ton of food. Rituals are fun and creative and good outlets for our constant state of anxiety!</p>



<p>Anyway, if ya&#8217;ll want personalized bone readings hit me up. I&#8217;m still learning, but they say practicing is the only way to get really sharp at this.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>If you could adapt any literary work into any type of video game, what work would you choose and why, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></p>



<p>Okay, yeah. Mathias Svalina does this Dream Delivery Service. He was in Tucson maybe two years ago and I subscribed for a month of dreams. He writes dreams every day and delivers them on bike to your doorstep early every morning. So, by the time I was up and leaving for work, I’d have this pink envelope stuck in my screendoor with a dream in it. The dreams are prose poems, for those not following.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’d adapt that. It would be like this: every day there’s a new five-ten minute experience you can play through. It’s one of those games where you just walk around and experience things (sorry, I don’t know video game lingo. I know there’s a word for this type of game. First-person walkabouts?). You briefly immerse yourself in a new dream reality every day and that’s it. That’s the game.</p>



<p><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></p>



<p>I have at least three different projects semi-started. Incubating? Maybe they’re all connected.</p>



<p>I’ve been writing a series of poems in this witch-aesthetic vein that pull a lot from Baba Yaga folktales, and there’s also some hunting &amp; shamanism stuff in there. Who knows where that is going.</p>



<p>For awhile I was writing a lot of poems about my time working in an animal shelter and about dog/human relationships in general. I own four dogs and have studied dog training and canine behavior quite a bit, so I have a lot of thoughts to work out there.</p>



<p>I also have a project started that’s connected to all this work I’ve been doing exploring my PA Dutch ancestry and, well, I guess I haven’t been back East in a few years and maybe this writing is a type of nostalgia. But also, wow! There’s this history of folk medicine/ritual healing/folk magic-type stuff among the PA Dutch! So I’ve been exploring that a lot through my reading and writing. And I feel really excited for that whole project to manifest and come together.</p>



<p><strong>What have you read recently that you want to recommend?</strong></p>



<p>Hm. Almost everything I’ve been reading lately if very specific to “research” for writing projects. I’m not sure if I’d recommend ya’ll go out and read grimoires or Russian folktales or academic essays on the Siberian Yukaghirs.</p>



<p>Oh, you know what I would definitely recommend though? <em>Crapalachia: A Biography of Place</em> by Scott McClanahan. It came out a few years ago, but I just read it this year and yeah, would highly recommend.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am thirteen when my grandfather dies.</p>
<p>I play <em>Dead or Alive 3</em> on my brother’s Xbox. This is one of the few games I am decent at. I am decent at it because it’s a button masher. I frenzy on the controller and often manage to stumble on a sequence that produces a combo attack. It takes little skill, finesse, or memorization. It just requires I go at it again and again. My brother tells me I only win because my attacks are so random, without logic, that the computer can’t predict and defend.</p>
<p>The <em>DOA</em> girls are beautiful. I want their soft-brown, long hair with perfect edges and messy bangs. I want their short, pink pixie hair and unblemished skin. I want to live in a world that’s shiny, everything high gloss. When I am older I will understand that these anime women are the real reason for the game’s popularity. I will understand that <em>DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball</em> was actually just a means to show these women bounce around in insanely impractical and revealing bikinis. At the time, I didn’t see the point of the theatrical interludes of the women playing joyfully on a tropical beach, of women slowly emerging from hot tubs. I thought<em>, Finally, a sports game for girls like me! </em></p>
<p>When I come home from school my parents meet me by the door and tell me my grandfather has died. They hug me and cry, but I don’t really cry. I go to my room and do my homework, and when I am older I will learn the term “dissociation.” I will learn that I have been dissociating for years, for decades.</p>
<p>My grandfather died in the spring and I spent what, in my memory, was my entire spring break playing <em>DOA 3.</em> My parents were at work or dealing with the aftermath. An entire house of stuff to sort through: boxes of <em>National Geographic </em>magazines, WWII fighter pilot uniforms, native Alaskan art, a garage brimming with scraps of wood and metal for projects that would never come to be. They were busy trying to find a way forward with my grandmother who had never lived alone, who didn’t know how to be without my grandfather. I did not know how to be without my grandfather, who took us for shopping sprees at Sam Goody. Shuttled us between afterschool activities. Bought us Dairy Queen on summer afternoons. Just a year before his death, he had crafted a longsword out of wood and helped me design and spray paint a suit of armor to wear for a class project. But I did not think about any of this then. I played <em>DOA</em>. I wondered if I could go without sleep, without food, without stepping outside. I didn’t question why I wanted this.</p>
<p>Now, my therapist says I am not connected to my body. She asks what emotions I feel and then asks where I feel them in my body. I guess, <em>uhm, like a heaviness in my chest? Like a heaviness in my stomach? Like tense? In my shoulders? </em></p>
<p>A new Modest Mouse album came out the same month my grandfather died, so, while playing <em>DOA</em>, I listened to <em>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</em> over and over on the boombox. I remember the sliding screen door being open, it was perfectly spring outside, the music feeling so in season. There was a dreamy lightness that buoyed me. The songs twangy and reverberating, the lyrics echoing and looping, at some moments sounding upbeat and frantic, at others a lullaby. I was in a trance.</p>
<p>The day before the funeral, we took my grandmother to the mortuary to see the body, to make sure everything looked <em>right.</em> Upon seeing him, hands folded on his chest, clean-shaven, in a casket, my grandmother said through tears that it didn’t look like him, he needed more rouge, he had always had such color in his cheeks. I knew then that this body was not my grandfather, that no amount of rouge could make it seem anything like him. I knew then that bodies were not people.</p>
<p>In meditation, my mind takes me to memories, and the memories are blank rooms I stand in. I stand in the basement of the church my grandparents went to, where every Sunday after mass, coffee and pastries were served. Where I sat in a white, button-up shirt with black, vertical stripes after my grandfather’s funeral, feeling like my clothes never fit right, embarrassed by my bout of stifled sobs that manifested into silent convulsions during the service. The tremor had run through me unexpectedly and filled me with shame before it sank into nothingness. I stand in my sister’s room where, during summer, I’d sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor because her room had window AC and mine didn’t. Her metal windchimes softly singing in the fan breeze. I am driving, I live in Tucson. I grip the wheel. What does it feel like? I look at my fingers.<em> The cat observes itself, </em>I think. I’m at the edge of the yard at my parents’ house in Pennsylvania, right where it begins to dip in a steep curve, the bank of the creek below obscured through tangles of trees. I’m digging up the shoebox we buried my sister’s guinea pig in last week—just to make sure. Except I’m not there, it’s an open hole and I can’t make out the contents. I’m standing in my grandparents’ kitchen, a painting of a man praying over bread above the dining table, there is a saucepan of melted butter on the stove for popcorn and soon my fingers will be slick with it. What did my grandparents couch feel like? Their carpet? Their hands? I can see it, but it’s nowhere in my body.</p>
<p>Each fight in <em>DOA</em> takes less than two minutes. When I got knocked out, I could hit <em>Continue </em>and retry on an infinite loop. The gameplay was repetitive, every level, every fight, just like the last. No character development to speak of and the story basically nonexistent, a loose shell for endless hand-to-hand combat. I liked the elegant movements, the gliding leg sweeps, the swift jabs. I liked being a cog in the never-ending system. I easily died hundreds of times that week as several different women. Against a tree in a forest filled with foliage, on the glass floor of an aquarium, while falling through the mist of a waterfall before landing on a mossy pillar of rock. The game’s graphics were beautiful and entrancing, like watching a screensaver while I waited for my life to buffer.</p>
<p>By the end of that spring break, I had accomplished something I never had before—I beat all of my brother’s high scores in a video game. I remember him being incredulous and kind of annoyed. I had beaten his scores not through skill but through sheer input, the way someone plays slots until hitting gold. He set to it and easily overtook my scores in a matter of days. That didn’t matter though. For that week, I had become the game. I existed in falling cherry blossoms, in paper-walled pagodas, in ice caves. I was a fierce warrior woman who was also so physically without flaw, without a wrinkle on her skintight dress with slits up past her hips, with enormous breasts, my god! The CD ends and I hit the <em>Play</em> button again. I hit <em>Continue</em> as the Game Over clock counts down from ten. I am in the room now but I can’t touch anything, I am years away from myself.</p>
<p>That spring, I get dental surgery and abuse painkillers for the first time. We paint the house my grandparents lived in and prepare it for sale. I cover my backpack in patches and squishy cartoon animal keychains that my grandfather had bought us, I scribble on them with Sharpie and poke paperclips through like voodoo dolls. I read <em>A Brief History of Time</em> and Shakespeare’s sonnets during study period. I read the words and retain nothing. I wait for the school year to end, for me to become a high school freshman. I feel blank. My hands act on the controller without me knowing which buttons are hit. Things happen on the screen and I’m unsure the cause. It’s all random. Sometimes you’re dead. Sometimes you’re alive. Sometimes both.</p>
