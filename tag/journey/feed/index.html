								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a feeling, once we achieve a certain speed, of flying, of lifting off from the ground, that flipping of the stomach, that lightheaded glee of gaining mastery of motion and gravity and time. It’s not a sustainable feeling because we are not built for that sort of life, lives of running, running, running. We burn out and fade to black if we sprint too hard and too fast. At least, that’s my experience, with life, with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic the Hedgehog, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with hurling forward, no brakes within reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This essay was supposed to be about mastering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I was supposed to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because I’ve always wanted to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I’ve always wanted to be tautological, even before I knew what it meant. When I was young and Sega Genesis younger, I snatched moments to control the hyper-propelled blue hedgehog and thrilled at the zoom, at the woosh, at crisp color lines, at spikes that curled into a frantic ball. I cruised past the first few stages, hurling Sonic-body in circular anger at bees, across chasms, through easily marked rocks, at the mustachioed villain. But I only had those brief snatches in which to play, and the awkward black controller never melded to the hands of Child-me. As a child, I assumed that when my hands grew, when I found the time to play and the money to buy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for myself, I would. And as a child, there was no sense of urgency. But my hands never grew large enough, and time isn’t what it appears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know how time moves, glacial, at first, and then faster and faster until it’s a blitzkrieg rush and suddenly we’re grey and wrinkled and wondering, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who on earth is that old man in the mirror? Who is the old woman who can hardly bend to tie shoelaces?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Who are we? What happened to the possibilities? What happened to my life to make it so small, to fit it inside boxes and trunks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time decides for us. I never had time to develop most of what I wanted to develop, and time has lengthened and what’s ahead of me is still long, but not as long as it once was. I thought that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was what this essay was supposed to be about, would be on that road. It’s hard to wax philosophic about video games, about an optional luxury, when there are so many other ways to dip into existentialist crises. There are friendships undeveloped, lovers unloved, skills and hobbies unseeded. I could have learned piano, I could have learned drums, I should have learned one of them to set folks’ feet on fire, caused them to dance and sway in the wind, dripping sweat, screaming smiles, rictus faces. I didn’t learn music; I never learned </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There were too many other developments to pour resources into, a heady nectar into a cup drained from the bottom into an empty ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What magical thinking to imagine future time will be less precious, simple to spare it? Not only time, but interest, intuition, intelligence? That the intense focus we used to spare on whatever catching our interest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">look, a bird, look, books on Norse Mythology, look, anything at all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will come when we call it? That when we want to run, when we need afterburners, we’ll be able to concentrate like the days of old? Because it doesn’t work like that anymore. We (or at least I) have too much other </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I don’t like to do, that I have to will iron into my bloodstream in order to force attention to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s lawns to mow, chairs to repair, dust to whisk, endless supplies of dishes to clean and clothes to clean and everything to clean. There’s IRBs to write, DSM-Vs to memorize, reports and audits to conduct because your job isn’t your passion and those acronyms aren’t going to embedded themselves into your brain when the field in which you grow fucks is starved by the lack of rain. Just because you think you want to learn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your brain doesn’t spark joy when you sprint and twirl into the air. When the mustachioed terror comes down in his little hover car and whips a giant ball and chain at you and you die and start over at the beginning and you think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this isn’t that fun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What kind of road is that to force yourself down, when you force yourself down so many highways every day you live?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2126" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2.jpg 640w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only so much time for joy these days. Rationing joy is counter-intuitive, so anti-joy, but it’s hard to appreciate rainbows, difficult to encapsulate a moment of inhibition-free dance, challenging to laugh without inhibition, when the weight of necessity bears shoulders to the earth. Joy shouldn’t be forced, not when bulwarks to life need to be pushed against the flood. I’m not going to force fun when there are better alternatives. I can’t force </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I can’t force platforming like a square peg when life has so many round openings. Maybe there’s a reason for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t ever much of a platformer. Select classics aside, timing jumps and avoiding patterned-enemies didn’t so much bring me pleasure as I aged. Sure, I played them, but they were asides, temporary pleasures. And there were other elements driving me more; the ninja panic in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaiden</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, absurdity of magic mushrooms and fireball plumbers in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Mario</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cannibalistic ingenuity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mega Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for all its hedgehog oddity, never had that extra. It seemed forced, a sped up, dumbed down, pallette-enhanced non-entity. It had the soul of Bennigan’s, the magic of made-for-TV adaptations. And without that 9th dimension, it was only a rapid platform, an artificial barrier to a journey explored and experienced. And an adventure is not what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is though an adventure is what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants to be. But this was never really about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventuring journeys are the lying name tags platformers wear, a road trip to the far side of imagination. But the journey is broken into digestible portions, moving platforms over open pits. Maybe that’s a perfect metaphor, maybe those disappearing/agitating/frenetic platforms that we slip from are exactly what life is. But maybe I don’t want my platformers to be too perfect, too dependent on skills I don’t have. Maybe I want my games to open my eyes and my heart, those weak, necessary organs that aren’t hard like bone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After failing to play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I tried other games on the disc I bought, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic Mega Collection, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loaded as it was with dozens of the Genesis’ very best. I tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecco the Dolphin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phantasy Star</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I tried </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altered Beast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I tried, I tried, I tried but all I could think was that this is what’s happened to an entire system, reduced to a novelty that cost me $5 after store credit, during my store’s going out of business sale. We’re all going out of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know it’s all about data and that data is better these days and can hold more, but how can all of these </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eccos</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and all these games I’ve wanted to play since forever, how can they fit on a disc so small? It’s only been two decades. How can 20 years change so much? I’m still the same me, even if I’m larger, grayer, objectively older; inside, I’ve hardly budged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and remember, this isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and none of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic’s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">brethren struck a spark in me, I tried something else, a game I’ve read about in other, better </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bit-Video-Games-Transformed-World/dp/0465039707" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essay-forms</span></a></span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (maybe just more empirical, more data-driven). First I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, basic games, in the sense that the only goal is to go forward, where life gets more difficult, if not less beautiful. And I walk forward (or fly forward) and the world expands and eventually it contracts and it feels like nothing besides life. And then it slows and it’s all just images, images on a screen. And it was short and then over, but I felt something form. A memory, but not a memory past, memory future, because the second of joy whilst playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whilst playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mattered, and joy is to be held onto with a light fist.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2127" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk3-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="320" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk3-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk3-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end, all we have of these journeys, these quests through space, dirt beneath toes, are memories and relics. And when we’re gone, those relics are boxed and put away or thrown into dumpsters. What happens to the sunlight we felt on our face when we were twelve? What happens to the castles built with wet sand, dripped from our fingers? Or the first time our lips touched another’s or the first cigarette we smoked, the way lungs burn with fire and ash? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can a lifetime’s worth of memories fit anywhere except infinity? And when an entire decade’s worth of imagination and hard work can be condensed into one little flimsy disc, it’s a symbol of our own continued obsolescence. Our own endless march to entropy. Our sped-up dash to the future-unknown. The hedgehog runs but gets nowhere, because video games are only ouroboros. Continue? Finish and start over? Continue? Finish and start over. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has only three lives but infinite press-starts. Our own lives don’t work that way, not unless the Hindus are correct (god, I hope they’re correct). </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a microcosm of nothing, only a segment, only a byte, only 1/32 of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic’s Mega Collection</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but this isn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is about taking a step forward, toward a distant mountain that can never be reached. About striving for excellence because excellence is strived for, because tautology is tautology and that’s enough. It’s about feeling because if there’s no point, the only reason for life is experiential, because moments have to matter. And finding moments of joy, of sublime reason, is starlight in angel wings. Feeling wind and sun and a friend’s palm on skin so that memory is tattooed with moments, endless moments upon moments, a glimpse of immortality.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2128" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sonk4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video games feel a paltry way to connect with inner thoughts and beauty. And maybe they are. But they evolve as we do. They can be simple as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zork, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">text and text, and only a few years later, they encompass </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgZXiHfNt0M"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And not long after that, an odyssey where there is no violence, no death, only flowers bringing life to an empty land. They allow the mind, the endless ego, to connect. They allow us to reach across the void in small ways, as rickety rope bridges, as spiderwebs, they allow us obtuse angles into the greater known. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did that for those who live by whirling dervishes and souped-up nitro engines. Mad Max liked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Iceman and Goose played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the mess hall. Usain Bolt is tattooed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it’s not </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for me, but without </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who knows if I would have felt even a moment of joy, and I don’t discount joy lightly. For a few brief moments I felt pleasure when before, I felt nothing at all except mild discouragement, a scolding from a teacher, an eyeroll from a cashier, a honking horn maybe aimed at me, maybe not. And that’s enough to forgive a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe this isn’t about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but maybe that burst of speed was enough to get me to where I needed to be. Who cares if I don’t play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? I barely care myself. No, I needed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to remind myself to dedicate myself to what matters. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn’t matter but very little matters, only what we decide matters for ourselves. And I won’t waste that time.</span></p>
