								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If writing a thoughtful, thorough, stimulating nonfiction book about a video game sounds like a challenge, then choosing <em>Kingdom Hearts II </em>as the subject of such a book must be performing that task on Expert mode. The Kingdom Hearts series of games consists of several more spin-offs and prequels (e.g., <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</em>, etc.) than “core” titles. To learn the complicated lore seems almost impossible. Not only is there a great quantity of games and characters therein, but their stories are mysterious, confusing, and vague, even intentionally so. As quoted in this new title from Boss Fight Books, director Tetsuya Nomura has stated, “Whether it’s game, anime, or manga, there should be a place where you can speculate things. I feel that way, so I wanted to make a game that gives space for your imagination. That’s why I don’t like revealing everything and saying, ‘This is the answer.’” So how does one write the book on one game in a series whose creator takes pride in weaving intricate narratives that are full to bursting with the unexplained?</p>
<p>Despite this high degree of difficulty, <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/kingdom-hearts-ii-by-alexa-ray-corriea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Kingdom Hearts II  </em>author Alexa Ray Corriea</a> describes the game in such a lucid way that even a neophyte will understand and appreciate her summaries of the plot and analysis of the characters. While a lesser writer might have gotten bogged down in the minutiae of the game’s many worlds, mechanics, and supporting cast, Corriea deftly distills the sprawling story into just the essential details that the reader need know in order to grasp the context surrounding her deep dives into the game’s finer points. Readers who haven’t played <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> (and even those who have, who can be forgiven for forgetting some things in the twelve years since this game’s release) will receive a helpful primer on its heroes and villains (and all the shades of gray in between), but a modest one in service of what’s really important here: Corriea’s dissection of the game’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>While similar titles might take the reader chronologically through a game’s story, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> emphasizes theme and subject matter in the organization of its ideas. Each chapter reads like a standalone essay in which Corriea examines a new aspect of the game, or the game as a whole from a new angle. In “Gone Girl,” she looks at the game through a feminist lens, magnifying the shortcomings of the one-dimensional female “lead,” Kairi, while elevating the virtues of the more complex Naminé. In “Bad Romances and Rad Bromances,” Corriea challenges the perceived significance of the romance between Kairi and protagonist Sora, while making a persuasive case that the much more important relationship is the homosocial one between Sora and best friend Riku. In “Riku and Redemption, or, What Doesn’t Kill You,” she uses the subplot of the tortured anti-hero to tackle universal questions about what makes a good person and the dichotomy of light and darkness in all of us.</p>
<p>Beyond the profundity of these close readings of <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>, Corriea also grabs the reader by revealing her personal attachment to the game series. In the prologue, she describes her relationship with her younger brothers, Raymond, who underwent many treatments for achondroplasia throughout childhood, and Jake, who was unexpectedly born ten years after her. The first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game united these three siblings, disparate in age, as she writes: “When the game ended, we all cried, watching Riku shut himself behind the large white door to the dark realm and watching Sora float away into the surrounding blackness. We talked about how the game made us realize we would always be okay if we had each other’s backs.” In the chapter about learning from Riku, Corriea also pays tribute to her own best friend, saying, “Christilynn and I were inseparable in the little fantasy worlds we built for ourselves, and we dove into Kingdom Hearts with gusto.” These moments of insight into the author’s life help to raise the emotional stakes for readers, as we come to see the game as not only a cultural artifact but also a formative experience.</p>
<p>Much like the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games themselves, Corriea’s <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> finds power in hybridity, blending personal essay with intellectual critique. Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is how it honors its subject without being precious about it. The author does not allow nostalgia to cloud her judgment. Instead, she casts an unflinching gaze at the flaws in <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Hearts II</em>, especially in the chapter that covers the game’s notorious first few hours of playing as new character Roxas. Corriea scrutinizes this section of the game and its infamy early on in her book, thus setting a precedent that she will fairly assess the game’s shortcomings rather than merely singing its praises. With anticipation and hype for <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> currently escalating, now is the perfect moment to reflect on the franchise’s history, and Corriea’s <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> provides that backward look with both well-earned pathos and scholarly rigor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>An excerpt from <a target="_blank" href="http://bossfightbooks.com/products/baldurs-gate-ii-by-matt-bell">Baldur&#8217;s Gate II</a></em></p>
<p><em>Baldur’s Gate II</em>’s Infinity Engine portrays the player character and each additional party member with a hand-painted portrait, which is used in the sidebar of the user interface, in dialogue windows, and in the character record screen. It also provides a pixelated sprite, which represents the character during gameplay and ingame cinematics, and in the inventory screen, where a slightly more detailed version can be dressed in equipment found in dungeons or shops. Character sprites are essentially undifferentiated: There are default sprites for each player race and class combination, and without weaponry or armor most characters look more or less like any other, except for minor customizations available for the color of skin, hair, and clothing.</p>
<p>Every character of the same race and class has the same haircut, the same blank facial expression too small to see outside of the inventory screen, and as the game progresses, other sprites repeat too. For every enemy type, there is a single sprite, meaning you’re frequently ambushed by a set of identical gnolls, hobgoblins, or soldiers. Elsewhere, unique demons get their own names but then walk and talk and fight and die like any other, and by the time the game ends you will have been attacked by dozens of interchangeable elementals, trolls, beholders, mind flayers, and so on. Variations within a type of enemy are at best depicted by color-swapped sprites, with uniforms on a more dangerous breed of hobgoblin appearing green instead of red.</p>
<p>Back in 2000, I’m not sure how obvious it was to me that I found the roughness of sprites more inviting than fully realized 3D models, but in the years since I’ve often felt a creeping nostalgia for sprite-based games, as year after year we move slowly across the uncanny valley toward fully convincing photorealistic characters. Given the number of retro-styled games coming out from indie game developers, I know I’m not alone in desiring the deceptively simple graphics of earlier games. I can still remember the outsized investment of imagination that went into my characters in RPGs like <em>Pools of Radiance</em> or tactical games like <em>X-COM: UFO Defense</em> and <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em>, all of which had relatively simplistic sprite-based characters and enemies. Each of the sprites in these games took up precious memory, and had to be drawn by hand, pixel by pixel, one variation for every frame of movement, so what makes your enemies unique is not graphical differentiation but context and imagination.</p>
<p>Despite the lengthy story and the deliberate character-building present in <em>BG2</em>, most of your time in-game is spent not in dialogue or active role-playing but in watching your party’s sprites walking from one edge of the screen to the next, doing your will with only minor exclamations, and frequently engaging in miniature battles with other similarly-sized sprites. For the game to be emotionally engaging—instead of simply a puzzle to be solved—the player must imbue these sprites with additional purpose and interest, going beyond what is given. But how exactly does this work? How do these barely-defined characters spur our imaginations to earn our affection?</p>
<p>Much to the benefit of the simulation in <em>Baldur’s Gate II</em>, I rarely think of the characters on the screen as “sprites.” Deep in a play session, I interpret the hobgoblin sprites as <em>actual</em> hobgoblins, filling in from imagination and experiences with D&amp;D novels and game materials the requisite details, the yellowish eyes, the goblinoid features, the growled mish-mash of human and goblin languages, the brutality and aggression.</p>
<p>Part of what created this investment was a precise lack of detail writers call “flatness,” a way of making room for the reader to fill in motivations, psychology, physical details, or other attributes of characters and settings: As you make the characters yours, equipping weapons and divvying up treasure and choosing color schemes for armor, or even just trying to imagine why your character might be doing the things the game asks him or her to do, you’re also subconsciously thinking about the kind of person those choices might represent. And when certain traits seem to exhibit themselves during gameplay—for instance, in my playthrough, Minsc dies more than any other character, because he’s my frontline fighter—you begin to fashion explanations for this behavior, imagining its effects on the character you’ve conjured in collaboration with the game.</p>
<p>In her essay “Fairy Tale is Form, Form is Fairy Tale,” the writer Kate Bernheimer describes flat characters as “silhouettes,” saying they “are not given many emotions—perhaps one, such as happy or sad—and that they are not in psychological conflict.” Bernheimer praises flatness because “it allows depth and response in the reader,” an effect which occurs in part because the writer has minimized the amount of psychological insight offered for the actions of characters, leaving room for the reader to create what wasn’t given. In the most successful examples, this creates a striking effect, because readers will provide whatever the story does not, filling in the blank side of the silhouette with the best material they have to offer: their own imaginations, emotions, and worldviews.</p>
<p>The <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> games, with their NPC party members that come complete with their own preexisting personalities and their own quests to complete, break away from the older D&amp;D games like the 1988 Gold Box title, <em>Pool of Radiance</em>, which required you to create your entire party of adventurers. But even with their recorded dialogue and personal storylines, the characters in BG2 still seem flatter than the characters in later, more cinematic BioWare games, where character models become more realistic with each game and where stories are fleshed out over dozens of hours of fully-voiced and lip-synched dialogue.</p>
<p>The most memorable <em>BG2</em> characters each have fascinating backstories that lead to quests you’ll need to undertake to keep them in your party, but much of this content is restricted to a very narrow part of the overall game experience. Across hundreds of hours of gameplay, you might spend little more than an hour or two taking care of each of their individual wants. For the rest of your time together, they will want what you want, go where you point, and do what you command. When they speak, it will appear as if they are interjecting of their own volition, but their interjections are triggered by your actions: If Aerie is not there to cheer your good deeds, then one of the other good-aligned party members interjects instead, Keldorn or Valygar or Mazzy or Nalia or whoever happens to be with you at the moment. Same goes for an evil decision, a betrayal or extortion or some unnecessary bit of violence causing Korgan or Edwin or Viconia to express their approval, often in exactly the same places.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the characters do have a kind of morality threshold, where they will refuse to join your party (or will leave it) if you become too good or too evil. This creates an appearance of complexity, but it’s merely numerical. Their morality threshold is usually a hardcoded number, and as long as you stay one point of goodness or evil above or below, their final moral objection will not occur. These characters are only moral agents when the story calls upon them to be, and any additional depth they appear to possess is something the player has added. For example, if you’ve ever refused to betray someone in BG2 because it wouldn’t be true to your character or because you think Jaheira or Minsc would disapprove, then you’ve experienced the personal investment in character this system can create—your behavior is shaped even without a specific gameplay reward to drive your decision.</p>
<p>Another of Muzyka and Zeschuk’s design guidelines that shaped the development of<em> Baldur’s Gate II</em> was the idea that “it is important that the player is able to personalize his or her character. This means that they should feel that the characters they are playing as are their own.” And so as the game begins, your player character is little more than one of Bernheimer’s silhouettes, a blank ready to be filled in with your choices during character creation, where you choose your own race, gender, and class, plus your starting abilities, like weapon proficiencies and beginning spells.</p>
<p>At first, even your inventory screen contains only what amounts to a paper doll, a flat representation of your character waiting to be dressed up with +1 long swords and magic wands and suits of enchanted mail. Dressing up this paper doll is a big part of forming an attachment to the character: As you gain new equipment, you will of course give your character the equipment best suiting his or her abilities, but more than likely you also make aesthetic choices fitting the kind of character you’ve imagined as you played.</p>
<p>Gorion’s Ward is the only character you create almost entirely yourself, and so paradoxically it’s the protagonist of the game who ends up being the flattest character. We learn about him or her only through our actions and dialogue choices, and Gorion’s Ward’s speech is never voiced except for a few exclamations. However you end up feeling about the story’s protagonist, most likely he or she is a character you’ve imagined yourself, spun out of the often-limited tools the game provides.</p>
<p>This effect is where the game most closely simulates playing pen-and-paper <em>D&amp;D</em>, translating a series of statistics and an inventory into what feels like a living breathing person, a person whose life you have inhabited since the moment of their creation, an event occurring simultaneously in your mind and upon the character sheet or the computer screen.</p>
<p>A <em>D&amp;D</em> character begins not with birth but with the first choice we make for them once they’re let loose into the game world, or the first request we make of the dungeon master, or the first click of the mouse toward some destination on the other side of the screen. <em>Go here</em>, we say. <em>Do this. Fight this monster. Cast this spell. Open this chest.</em> Repeat. Hours pass. Days and weeks and months pass, command after command filling the empty vessel of the player character. Experience is acquired, levels are earned, new spells are scribbled into spellbooks, mundane swords and axes are replaced with deadlier magical weapons, and basic sets of chainmail are exchanged for ornate suits of enchanted plate mail. And then one day playing dress-up becomes something else. What is it you see when you turn the paper doll around in your imagination? Not an empty silhouette but a character coming alive, a container filled with you.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Justin Lawrence Daugherty: What were the highlights of the first year of Boss Fight Books? What has really stood out for you?</strong></p>
<p>Gabe Durham: Getting those first paperback copies of <em>EarthBound</em> in the mail was hugely exciting. The existence of a Boss Fight Books wiki was oddly validating. Meeting people who get what we’re doing feel great—particularly when someone has read multiple books and embraces the ways the books are different from one another. It was cool and surreal to work on forewords with gaming legends like Howard Phillips, Ted Woolsey, and Marcus Lindblom. As an editor, I got to witness and be a part of a lot of breakthrough moments when working on these books—watching them take shape from one draft to the next. Taking little bits of free time here and there to work on my own book, <em>Bible Adventures</em>, has been really sustaining. My life is now so full of the logistics of running the press now that it would really bum me out if my own writing accidentally went away.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight is also the most general: The job-well-done feeling of bringing these books to life. It’s way more work than I thought it would be, and yet now these first six books really do exist, out of our little laboratory and into the world.</p>
<p><strong>JLD: So, the Kickstarter for the 2<sup>nd</sup> season of Boss Fight is going crazily strong. Are you surprised by the support and turnout?</strong></p>
<p>GD: I’m really pleased. Day One in particular did better than I’d hoped. I was relieved to see a lot of people who supported Season 1 come back for Season 2, eager for more. It feels like there’s more trust this time around, now that Boss Fight is transforming from “a cool idea for a press” into an actual press with six books out and more on the way.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know what to expect from a second Kickstarter: The company already exists, so what’s being funded isn’t a new concept but an extension of an existing one. So the excitement this time is more on the individual books themselves.</p>
<p>What helps me not feel slimy about crowdfunding is that we’re not giving the hard sell, asking for free money—we’re just offering up our future catalogue for (very) early pre-order so that we can take the money and put it toward the new season. Putting out a book is so time- and resource-consuming that having these early orders on hand is such a relief. I’m really grateful to everyone who is backing us in advance through the Kickstarter.</p>
<p><strong><strong>JLD: </strong>Tell us about some of the books already slated for the 2<sup>nd</sup> season at BFB. What can we expect from the upcoming cascade of books?</strong></p>
<p><span>GD: </span>Right now, it’s looking like the first half of the season will be <em>Baldur’s Gate II, Metal Gear Solid, </em>and<em> Bible Adventures</em>. All three of these books have been in the works for longer than <em>Spelunky</em> or <em>WoW</em>.</p>
<p>Matt Bell and I had a full back-and-forth edit and conversation about his first <em>BG2</em> draft, and he wrote me this week to say he jettisoned most of what was the largest thread in that first draft. So I’m excited: What I read in the second draft is going to be as much new material as old.</p>
<p>Ashly and Anthony finished a full draft of <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>almost a year ago, and have been super patient each time I’ve sidelined my edits on their book for Season 1 edits! The good news is that Season 1 is done, so it’s been awesome this week to jump back into the book with them. We’ve been prepping an excerpt for publication, one that looks closely at gender in <em>MGS</em>. What with all that’s been going on in the game world lately, this chapter feels pretty timely and very evenhanded. We pitch the book as a “celebration/takedown” of MGS, but the celebration feels (to me) like the heart of the book—looking hard at a flawed, messy game and loving it anyway.</p>
<p><strong><strong>JLD: </strong>What motivated you to get BFB started? What&#8217;s your philosophy behind the work? </strong></p>
<p><span>GD: </span>It began as a “What if…?” What if there was a 33 1/3 for video games? It’s rare to have an idea for a thing and then look on the internet and find that the thing doesn’t exist. In the couple years before Boss Fight, I’d been reading a lot of nonfiction—David Shields, John D’Agata, Joy Williams, Truman Capote—and was excited about the genre’s potential.</p>
<p>So I toyed with the idea, batted it around in my mind, began talking to people about it, and read <em>Extra Lives</em> very quickly. Then I put out a call for friends to tell me about their favorite games writing on Facebook and then dove deep into what they sent me. Reading all this smart writing about games made me realize just how much there was to explore, how many different angles a writer could take.</p>
<p>I also noticed things that could be better: For one thing, games writing often seemed like an island unto itself, its writers unwilling or unable to fold games into the bigger tent of arts criticism. When Tom Bissell mentioned a novel in the same breath as a game, it was a surprise only because so few people were respected both games and books enough to make those connections.</p>
<p>But it shouldn’t be a surprise! All the most interesting people I know exhibit curiosity that reaches far beyond their own disciplines. That was the main reason I wanted to work with Jon Irwin. In his Kill Screen articles, he was really awake to those connections, bringing up Joan Didion when discussing the new <em>GTA</em> and really making it connect.</p>
<p>So I thought it would be valuable to (1) give a new platform to creative people who were already in the games world, and (2) see what writers who were not explicitly games writers would do when focusing on a single game. Each author is bringing something different to the table, approaching their subject in a way nobody else can.</p>
<p><strong><strong>JLD: </strong>Can you divulge your sleepers for games you really want to see excellent pitches for?</strong></p>
<p><span>GD: </span>I’m slowly learning to articulate what I want from these books. Most of all, a ground-up approach rooted in curiosity.  Like: “I want to write about The Legend of Zelda and X.” Or: “I want to write about The Legend of Zelda through the lens of X.” The author picks a game because it presents them with burning questions that it’s going to take a whole book to investigate, and then formulates an approach. All the while digging deep into research, all the while playing the game in question and making notes.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to want to write about a game because the game is cool—What about your take on the game is going to make us think thoughts and feel feelings? Good works of nonfiction are explorations. If we were lazy, we could just settle on a formula: a little history, a little autobiography, describe some gameplay, end on an emotional note, and call it a day. Already with some pitches, I’ve had people say, “I’d like to do kind of an <em>EarthBound</em> thing with it…” and I start to tune out. I’ve read <em>EarthBound</em>! Many times.</p>
<p>The larger problem, though, is that so many of the pitches we’ve received are excellent, doing all the right things, and we still have to say no.</p>
<p>None of this is answering your question. I want to see pitches in genres and franchises we haven’t explored yet, ever-widening the circle of possibility. Or I want to see pitches in genres and franchises we have explored, but from radically new angles.</p>
<p><strong><strong>JLD: </strong>What are your thoughts on publishing books of fiction or poetry on video games? Any plans?</strong></p>
<p><span>GD: </span>We’re publishing some fiction in the new anthology, <em>Continue?</em>, along with some weird prose like a couple Brian Oliu’s <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em> pieces, which is a nice change of pace. The idea of Boss Fight eventually publishing other, weirder books outside of the numbered series interests me.</p>
<p>It’s important to me, though, that the main series titles all fall under the loose label of nonfiction. Not only is publishing fiction about game characters a rights issue, it’d be getting away from the theme of the series—curiosity. What happens when we devote so much attention to these singular art objects? What can games tell us about the world and ourselves? Fiction can of course do this too, but not as directly.</p>
<p><strong><strong>JLD: </strong>What are you playing right now? What have you loved most recently?</strong></p>
<p><span>GD: </span>This year, the game I’ve spent the most time playing has been <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, first on its own and then with the Wrath of the Lamb expansion. I was really curious because (1) it’s often mentioned in the same breath as <em>Spelunky</em> and (2) I’ve been working on the <em>Bible Adventures </em>book, and I was curious to see how the game uses Bible tropes. And the answer is: very playfully. It’s a really smart game, and so addictive. Really interested to see what the new version, <em>Rebirth</em>, is like.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I’ve been making my way through the Mass Effect trilogy and am now on <em>ME3</em>. I’m a FemShep, obviously, because good voice acting is important. And then most recently, I’ve been playing <em>Osmos</em> on Steam, which is a really nice and calming cosmic take on the “become the biggest fish in the ocean” genre.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Michael Kimball:</strong> I know nothing about you except that you like video games, so what was the first video game you loved and why?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Tarantino:</strong> The first video game I loved? Love is a strong emotion so I have to believe it&#8217;s the one that left the most permanent impression. First, some background. I was the progeny of my father&#8217;s second marriage and my brother lived up on Long Island, NY. I would only see him when he came down during the summer and I was at my dad&#8217;s house (my parents split up before I was in 1st grade and I went to live with my mom). So, during those rare instances of time actually together, we played the NES at my dad&#8217;s house. One of the only co-op games we had was <em>Bubble Bobble</em>. You played these adorable little dragons that could shoot bubbles, and they could also hop on bubbles and capture enemies with their bubbles. A lot of pastels and cutesy imagery, but the game was hard to us as kids. I remember we&#8217;d always try and try to beat the game (level 99, I believe) until one day we actually succeeded. I think my brother found some bypass scenario akin to Mario Bros. games. But the result was still sweet: we beat the final boss and were ecstatic. We never could beat the game again no matter how hard we tried. However, we loved playing that game together, something our separate lives (Pennsylvania and NY) could never come close to.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> Part of what made <em>Galaga</em> an important game to me was playing with my friend Todd. And my girlfriend Molly and I play this stupid-yet-beautiful game called <em>Bust-a-Move</em> that probably wouldn’t be that much fun playing with anybody else. What other games did you and your brother especially like playing together? And/or, are there any other games that were special because of the person with whom you played that game?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino:</strong> Because of my older brother living in NY and me living in PA with my mother, we didn&#8217;t really get to see each other a lot. I can remember playing college football games on the Genesis when I was in middle school and my brother was in high school during some summers, but nothing like a bonding experience we had previously. He was more into summer flings and I was, well, more of a nerd. I didn&#8217;t really play games with other people until I got my own Xbox (original) and went to college. I remember playing <em>Halo </em>with some of the guys on my floor my freshmen year, but I was far and away the most prolific of gamers. My sophomore year I made friends with two guys and one of them, Steve Watts, was <em>really</em> into gaming. So much so that now he&#8217;s the Editor-in-Chief for Shacknews.com. Steve helped with being okay with my nerdy gaming side. We&#8217;d play (mostly his games) <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>., etc. You know, the staples of college life in the early 2000s. After college, when I made a fateful decision to buy an Xbox 360 without my wife&#8217;s consent (did not repeat this mistake with the Xbox One), I slowly found a group of gamers online through the classic (and un-molested) beauty <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em>. A group of us met regularly online to play the Multiplayer as well as on the Activision (maybe Treyarch/Infinity Ward?) forums for W@W until we all decided to end our association with the repressive moderation of said forums through a mass banning. From that we started our own forum site at <a href="http://4rumboys.com">4rumboys.com</a> and have stuck together now after almost 5 years. I haven&#8217;t met any of them in person, but we regularly keep informed of everything going on through our website and through Facebook. Now, I am normally one to focus on single-player games, being a father of two young children, but it&#8217;s good to get online and talk to friends who are as dedicated (and sometimes obsessed) as you are about gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> So what happened when you bought the Xbox 360 without your wife’s consent?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino:</strong> I bought it at discount when Circuit City was going out of business. One of those, I&#8217;m going out to get this one thing from Circuit City because they have a big sale; which turns into me coming home with the XBox 360 as well. I can&#8217;t remember what else I bought. Naturally it was a fight about money and responsibility. No amount of pleading on my side about the phenomenal deal I got would soothe it over.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball: </strong>Why do you think you are so obsessed with gaming? Or would you use a different term to describe your relation to gaming?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino: </strong>I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m obsessed with gaming. I&#8217;m very passionate about it. I thoroughly enjoy my time playing video games, but I know I have other responsibilities and I also have other passions in life. I know that I&#8217;ve molded myself into a person that other people want to talk to—and that means staying away from talking about video games with my peers (30+ professional crowd). The other hard part of not being obsessed is because I know my wife doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get it,&#8221; as we have talked about many times. Sure, she could play hours (and does) of <em>Freefall</em> or <em>Angry Birds</em>, but as soon as I pick up the XBox controller when our children are asleep—it verges on an argument. I have told her on multiple occasions that I like to decompress by playing video games because I don&#8217;t have to worry about anything. I also don&#8217;t spend hours in front of the TV playing video games when I know I have other responsibilities.</p>
<p>Enough of the rant about my non-obsession. Why am I passionate about video games? I have grown up with video games. When my parents divorced and I lived with my father until 4th grade, video games were there to distract me while he worked on starting his own business. When I went to live with my mother and my older sister, video games were there to distract me while my mother worked all day. I found the worlds of video games fascinating, an escape from my situation, much akin to what you described in your book. I think my wife is afraid because of the horror stories of video game addicts. However, I&#8217;ve done this for most of my life and I know how to put down the controller. The video games have matured and grown in terms of depth so much that it is quite amazing. I remember finishing the original <em>Halo Triology</em>. Epic story with a good finish. I never got around to finishing <em>Halo 4</em>, but still: a good story. Then you have franchises like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>, which have blown open the doors on how deep a video game universe can be (yes, yes, and <em>World of Warcraft</em>). You have these pieces of interactive digital art and storytelling that allows users to go beyond their simple lives and do great things. I love that. I love that I can look at a distinct twist in the history of the world (the <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> franchise) and take part in that history. The story is amazing and the gameplay, with the advent of next gen consoles, continues to improve drastically. Look at the recent critically acclaimed IP of <em>Destiny</em>. I picked up a copy because the story was supposed to be good. While the story, as people found out, isn&#8217;t all that deep on the ground surface (good guys fight universal evil), you come to understand there is something deeper. Why is the Darkness coming after us? What is the Darkness? Are we really the threat to the universe? It&#8217;s fascinating. Obssessed? No. Passionate and dedicated.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> How would you describe the “it” that your wife does not get?</p>
<p><strong>Taratino: </strong>I&#8217;ve wondered about this a lot since getting married. Funny how some things you never talk about during dating and courtship turn into issues when you become married. On the surface, I believe my wife thinks playing video games is both childish and shirking responsibilities. Yet I believe it&#8217;s also rooted in my wife feeling that we don&#8217;t spend enough time together. There may be truths in both. Simply, she didn&#8217;t grow up with the same life situations that I did. I come from a broken home and was torn from my dad&#8217;s custody before 4th grade to live with my mom. As I said before, video games were an escape from my predicament for me. I never made, nor make, lasting friendships (except with my wife) because then you can&#8217;t be hurt. (Such a good movie premise, I know.) Video games were there to take me away from it all. My wife grew up with a conservative mother and father who didn&#8217;t even let her have sugary cereal until she was in high school. She was more sheltered and encouraged to pursue activities such as piano, track and field, and soccer. While we&#8217;re both introverts, my wife and I cope with it differently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought a lot about the gaming culture and I have to say it&#8217;s a balancing act between true obsession/addiction on one side and a normal habit on the other. See, habit, it&#8217;s the first word I thought of. You wrote about driving the Ohio Turnpike and getting that &#8220;itch&#8221; to play every <em>Galaga</em> machine you and your girlfriend could find until you realized what was happening. Is that an addiction? Or is it okay to indulge yourself to that extent? Remember, it&#8217;s not like I sit at home all day neglecting my children, my family, or my career to play video games &#8212; that&#8217;s addiction. I do play to relieve my stress (and add new fictitious stress) at the end of the day. It&#8217;s mind-numbing and I believe that&#8217;s another reason my wife doesn&#8217;t like it. Maybe she sees it as the slide into total addiction.</p>
<p>So, in short, it&#8217;s a combination of all facets of what&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; about video games. Whenever I ask my wife why it upsets her, it&#8217;s the same: waste of time; waste of energy; and it&#8217;s childish. It&#8217;s something that her and I can&#8217;t relate to with each other and maybe on some level that upsets her.</p>
<p><strong>Kimball:</strong> I’m glad that Molly likes to play games as much as I do. Having that play in my life makes me a happier person and gives me a sense of satisfaction that I often find difficult to explain. I’m circling back to something you said in your first answer: What makes winning a boss fight so satisfying?</p>
<p><strong>Tarantino:</strong> Boss fights are the culmination of everything you have worked towards in the game. Or should be. There can be really great boss fights: I think of the first two <em>Mass Effect</em> games. The third installment had the finality everyone wanted, but the boss fight was more of a bother than an actual ending. There are really bad boss fights, my personal example being the <em>Deus Ex:</em> <em>Human Evolution</em> final fight. So you go around beating this group of rogue cybernetic humans as bosses throughout the game and the final one has this insanely powerful shotgun. I think I replayed the fight, since I kept dying, seven or eight times before I finally just looked up the ending on the internet and called it quits. Some people may say that&#8217;s a quitter’s mentality, but maybe I want my leveling up to mean something. Boss fights should be challenging, yes, but should not be something that is baiting you for a &#8220;rage-quit&#8221; or for the abject disappointment of having to remember an intricate pattern. Boss fights, in my opinion, should be a challenging reward, not so tough and complicated you need to do everything perfectly correct in order to win.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabe Durham, our friend over at <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com" target="_blank">Boss Fight Books</a>, has recently announced a second &#8220;season&#8221; of video game books, and it looks absolutely incredible. All those mentioned above, an investigation into the making of <em>Bible Adventures</em><strong></strong> by Gabe himself, plus a sixth book that will cover whatever game receives the most votes—donate to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gabedurham/boss-fight-books-season-2" target="_blank">Kickstarter project</a> and get the chance to fill in a gap, perhaps, or read about your favorite game.</p>
<p><iframe width="800" height="600" style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem;" src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gabedurham/boss-fight-books-season-2/widget/video.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"> </iframe></p>
<p>Those who subscribe to Season 2, or did subscribe to Season 1, will also receive the <em>Boss Fight Books Anthology</em>, which features a host of talented people, including contributor Brian Oliu, and friend Mike Meginnis (one of the two people behind the publisher of Brian&#8217;s most recent book, <em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/07/29/play-leave-luck-heaven/" title="Play This: Leave Luck to Heaven" target="_blank">Leave Luck to Heaven</a></em>).</p>
<p>The writers that Gabe has corralled for this season are impressive and diverse—Matt Bell is best-known for his surreal novel-as-fable <em><i>In the House upon the Dirt between the Lake and the Woods</i></em>, while Ashly and Anthony Burch are famous for the video series &#8220;<span>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin.&#8221; And one can&#8217;t get much closer to the action, so to speak, than from the creator of <em>Spelunky</em> itself, Derek Yu.</span></p>
<p>Last year, Boss Fight Books pitched itself as the <span>&#8220;the </span>33 1/3<span> of video games&#8221; and launched titles that covered games like <em>EarthBound</em>, <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>ZZT</em>, and more.</span></p>
<p>This season of Boss Fight Books has already sped bast its funding goal with Sonic-like speed, but that doesn&#8217;t meant you shouldn&#8217;t contribute—meeting stretch goals makes the season better for everyone, and there&#8217;s something there for just about any type of gamer/reader out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gabedurham/boss-fight-books-season-2" target="_blank">Check out their Kickstarter project</a> and back it before November 18. Books will start heading out in January 2015.</p>
