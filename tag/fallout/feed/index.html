				<description><![CDATA[<p>Fallout 2 might be my favorite game of all time. It doesn’t have the same nostalgia factor that earlier games like Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger have, and it will never match the replay factor of the Ogre Battle series. It’s not as mind-numbing as Ken Griffey Jr. or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and it doesn’t have the camaraderie associations that Tekken 3 has. But what it does have is this: perfection.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is hard. Some folks fall in and out of love easily. Some take a little longer. I’m the longer and I don’t always maintain the love. I’m quite fond of quite a bit, but love? I love my wife (hi Leigh!), I love my family, I love my cats. I love a few friends. But otherwise? I love Thai Drunken Noodles and there’s this vegetarian buffalo “chicken” place in Portland that I dream about. And when it comes to pop culture? The love comes hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t fallen “in love” with too much pop culture. Sure, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">like</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all kinds of culture because culture, if it’s anything, is what individuals </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. What we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are social herd animals, made to disseminate information and to share thoughts and feelings. Culture is the communion of one person and another person and their friends and their family until tendrils spread Cthulhu-like. Culture is cool, ever since that first caveman was like, “yo, look at these dope paintings” and another caveman was like, “meh. I’ve seen better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Dokken; from amusement parks and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everybody Hates Chris</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Thelonious Monk and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">X-Men</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I like a ton. But love? Love, again, is hard. I haven’t found too much to love. I love reading, I love swimming, and I love video games. Sometimes, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t remember not playing video games. I had an older brother and he had an Atari. I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventure</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space Invaders</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frogger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My favorite was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asteroids</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I wouldn’t say I loved it. I thought it was cool, but I also liked the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soul Train/Brady Bunch </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">block on Nickelodeon. I liked playing with Legos and Tonka trucks. I was a child and to a child, the world is infinite. But while I liked video games and television, reading was really my jam. I read constantly, from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berenstain Bears</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Cauldron</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hobbit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Video games were a distant third, behind reading and running around outside. Maybe even fourth, if you count the aforementioned </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soul Train/Brady Bunch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when my brother leveled up and got a Nintendo, it wasn’t yet the come-to-Jesus moment. I didn’t thirst to play video games. Sure, I rocked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and all the other shitty and/or super difficult games on the Nintendo that I scarcely remember: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legendary Wings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kid Icarus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goonies II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They were great or they were terrible and when it was time to go outside and have acorn wars, well, that was fine. I even broke off gaming for homework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t until 1990 that I fell in love. Or became obsessed (depends upon your definition, I suppose). I’d always been into fantasy and sci-fi, ever since my dad played me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when I was too young to remember, and time strengthened that bond. I read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicles of Narnia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lord of the Rings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chronicles of Prydain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I was a tween. I knew more about Loki and Anansi than was healthy for any red-blooded American boy who didn’t want his ass kicked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fated, perhaps, that I would find </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Note: this essay is not about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m getting there. I might be burying the lede, but there’s a reason for everything. Trust the process, nameless reader. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FF</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was everything I didn’t know I wanted. It allowed me everything I didn’t have. I could be strong and wise, explore brave new worlds, seek out new life…and kill it. I could save princesses and grow into a stronger, better version of me. I’d find dragons and elves and whilst interacting with them, be a hero. Save the day. God knows I didn’t have much of that in my day-to-day life. I was a kid, with a high-need older brother and busy, overworked parents. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was my first video game love and one of my first pop culture loves, joining with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Wars</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as one of the sacrosanct. Eventually others would join: I’d discover Nirvana in junior high, weed (and weed culture) in high school, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in college. But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and from it, Role Playing Games in general, became my raison d’être. I couldn’t get enough of that shit. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrono Trigger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breath of Fire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dragon Warrior</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy IV</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">VI</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paladin’s Quest</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret of Mana</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Link to the Past</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Super Mario RPG</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogre Battle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I played them all and I played the ever loving bejeebus out of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I played the next generation of RPGs: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suikoden </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&amp; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suikoden II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vandal Hearts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tactics Ogre</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogre Battle 64</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagea, Knights of the Old Republic, Fable, Jade Empire, Dragon Force, Chrono Cross, Grandia I &amp; II</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I played every role playing game I could get my hand on and I loved them. Maybe not equally, but enough. There was something about them that never stopped pressing my endorphin buttons. I could sit and stare and play all day, all night. Sure, I stopped when my friends called or my girlfriends wanted to hang out or if I had a really good book (actually, books usually won). But I skipped life to role play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were reasons for all of that, of course, reasons I’m just now digging into. I’ve recently been diagnosed with Bipolar II (I have highs and lows, but my highs aren’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high and are outnumbered by the lows) and after many talks with shrinks, I’m coming to understand that the excessive video gaming bouts were numbing behaviors. It’s the same reason I smoked myself into oblivion for the better part of a decade. Sure I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loved </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">weed and RPGs, but I didn’t love them that much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my early 20s, I stepped away from video games for a few years of travel and volunteer work and discovered a taste for a lot more than I’d known. Travel, cooking, writing, working out, dancing. I was becoming a more whole person, learning and enjoying myself more. But that didn’t mean I didn’t like video games all of a sudden. It just meant my drive had dwindled and my focus was diluted, spread as it was into other, arguably healthier pursuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, my brother gave me his PS3. I didn’t particularly want it, but it was a nice gesture. And it tapped into a mild hankering for gaming that I hadn’t known was there. I hadn’t played much in years: none of my old games were doing it for me and I didn’t know how to find new ones. It was like when I stopped smoking weed regularly and wanted to get back into it. You can’t just saunter into high schools and start asking to buy some pot. That kind of tomfoolery ends poorly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took the PS3 and left it in my basement for six months before I touched it. Then, around Christmas time, Leigh asked me what I wanted so she could tell her parents. I did 5 minutes of Google searching and found this game called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a bunch of top-ten lists. I remembered vaguely hearing about it when it was all the rage. Lo and behold, on Christmas, my brother-in-law gifted me with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t need to go over the specifics of what happened when I touched </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/05/26/retrogamer-the-ruins-of-old-olney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first essay I wrote for <em>Cartridge Lit</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goes over that in quite some detail. But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FO3 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparked a resurgence in my video gaming, helped clarify what I was looking for. I wanted something different, wanted to challenge myself. And it worked. I discovered a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*No, this essay isn’t about that, either, but we are getting closer.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2264" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="370" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1.jpg 500w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic1-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">FO3, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved on a few months later to <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/11/10/retrogamer-the-tragedy-of-chocolate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And one half a year after that, with <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/04/26/retrogamer-rinse-repeat-reload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fallout</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve talked about those a lot, but I haven’t really discussed the overarching “something” that twinged and came into focus with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> universe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t help who you love. This cliché is usually used to absolve someone of remarkably poor choices in romantic partners. There’s a connection that occurs between people, chemical reactions and that, binding people together, sometimes inextricably. There is no conscious reason for it, no other logic beyond “this works.” Maybe it’s olfactory, maybe it’s destiny. Who knows? Smarter people than me are still stuck on the problem of love. “Shit happens” sums it up nicely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same can be said for pop culture. Why do people fall in love with what they do? Maybe there’s a subconscious switch. Maybe there’s a Freudian connection with oral/anal phases of development. I don’t know why I love the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> franchise so much. It’s dark and nihilistic, rife with gallows humor and intense hyper-violence. It’s glitchy and broken and there are so many dark places within. And still, for some reason, god I love it. Especially, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It builds upon its predecessor: more options, more companions, more viable builds, more locations, more factions, more accessories, more cars (just the one, but still). And it’s the first that expands the history and lore behind the world it inhabits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that fleshes out the super mutants and the ghouls, that begins to talk in more detail about vaults and Vault Tec. It’s the first that gets into nitty gritty world-building, what with left-behind AI, a plethora of data discs to read, countless NPCs to mine for information. It keeps the freedom of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kill who you want, break quests, who gives a shit?—but adds context and texture. It doesn’t necessarily answer a lot of questions or connect dots (it remains to be seen if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3, NV </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">4’s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">attention to detail in that regard is for the good or bad), but it sketches a world that is rich, vibrant, and with the illusion of life. A simulacrum of living. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be my favorite game of all time. It doesn’t have the same nostalgia factor that earlier games like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final Fantasy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrono Trigger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have, and it will never match the replay factor of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogre Battle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series. It’s not as mind-numbing as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Griffey Jr.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it doesn’t have the camaraderie associations that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tekken 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has. But what it does have is this: perfection. It’s as perfect a game as I’ve ever played. And it’s so, so rich in the one thing I love more than anything else. Story. A world. Lore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never not been interested in lore, in asking questions and learning answers. It’s why I fell in love with role playing genres to begin with. It’s why I played </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic: the Gathering</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and created histories for my invented characters in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s why I began writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started writing in high school and pursued it in college. But I wasn’t driven and, more importantly, I didn’t have much to say. I wrote a few short stories and a play, and they were well received (I suppose) by my college lit mag. But everything else I wrote just seemed to be pastiche, a derivation of a derivation of a carbon copy. After graduation, I made a conscious choice to put away my writing until I knew my asshole from my elbow enough to tell stories with conviction and originality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put away writing for a decade. And it stayed away. But then I wrote a short story because I had an image of a snowfall, and then I took a creative writing class on a lark when I got my second undergraduate degree. And I met a professor who inspired me, whose life I envied because he could talk about books and writing all day. So I applied to grad school for writing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I wondered: what do I write about? That question plagued me</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, I went to a reading of a local Baltimore writer for his book on <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/galaga-by-michael-kimball" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Galaga</em></a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I was like, “Holy shit, people can write about video games?” And I realized that, yes, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> write about it. And if other people can, then I too could write about anything I want. If Michael Kimball can write about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galaga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then maybe I can write about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or eventually, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/07/28/retrogamer-threshold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Galaga</em></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Not long after, I came upon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s submission call and I thought, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just want to play old games and make up for lost time. Maybe they’ll publish me if I write about my experiences*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thanks, Justin Daugherty and Joel Hans!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some time, I thought I was conning everyone. Here I get to do something I want to anyway, and get published for it. Have people read my words and, whether or not they like them, at least take the time to appreciate my spin. A couple of times a year, I DJ at a local club in Baltimore. I play music and people dance and I get paid for it and I think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shit. I’d do this for free.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve thought the same of Retrogamer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I mean, technically, I’ve written these essays for free, but I now have a body of work. I have 60,000 words on video games, enough to compile into a book. I’ve made contacts with writers throughout the country. Again, all for something I do for fun.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a heckuva journey. I’ve played more video games in the past two years than at any other moment of my life. I might be a grown ass man, but I’m good at time management and I know how to take care of responsibilities so I can play guilt-free. I’ve played more games than I’ve had space to write about, all the while saying “I’m working.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But playing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the pinnacle. How often does one come across “love” in their life? Yeah, falling in love with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is weird, y’all. But it’s a game that fits my humor, my style; it ticks every box I have. What can I even say about it when I want to say everything? Instead of saying everything, I’ll say this: I loved it, but it also brought a certain reality to light.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2265" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="320" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2.jpg 320w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FO2_Pic2-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing about video games isn’t forever. I’m kind of tapped out. I have other projects, other commitments. I’m mostly finished with a novel. I’m putting together writing retreats and panel discussions. I run an indie press that’s taking on more and more authors. This writing thing is becoming a career, a passion and a vocation and all that junk all wrapped up in one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video games need to become a hobby again. A hobby I really, really enjoy, but a hobby nonetheless. Retrogamer has never really been about the video game, and this essay is not really about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (though I recommend everyone play it who hasn’t already). It’s always been mostly about me, about my own journey, through a particular lens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’ve run out of things to say about me. So instead of forcing it, I’m just going to step away from Retrogamer, like a Lone Wanderer or a Vault Dweller. Not the Chosen One, cause that sounds super-duper pretentious and self-involved (though that’s the name of the hero in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fallout 2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would have had some nice circle-coming-back, but oh well), so maybe the Courier? Yeah, I like that. I’m the Courier, stepping away to take messages to other places*.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Let’s run with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, for now, I’m gonna say goodbye. Thanks to all those who read, and to the editors at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartridge Lit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for letting me ramble about the <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/08/25/arson-battlecats-majestic-sweater-vest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Giants</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/12/27/retrogamer-speed-dating-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ex-girlfriends</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and how, holy shit do I not give a crap about<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/06/30/retrogamer-an-objective-reality-and-a-croconaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Pokémon</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(#hottake). I dislike Pokémon as much as I love Fallout, and now I know it. I can appreciate it all a little better from outside. Because I’ve had a chance to live in the world of gaming and get caught up on so much that I missed: of video games and of writing and what’s in between. I’m happy about that. And I’m ready to move on.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hour 1</strong>: Springtime, a Saturday. Just went running. Leigh says, <em>no, shower first</em>. I say, <em>But no</em>. The game takes precedence. I got a laptop for this. I learned Steam. Leigh says, <em>fine. </em>I load <em>Fallout</em> and choose the woman. I choose traits. I will be an unarmed specialist. I will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 1.5</strong>: <em>Fallout </em>opens. What would it have been like to play this in ‘97, when it debuted? Nearly two decades in the future, I have too much knowledge of its future for the same experience. Post-apocalypse. Hidden underground Vaults of humanity. The broken spine of the Western United States. An isometric, top-down  role-playing experience. Violence and sex and crude language. Horror. Morality. I try to wipe my mind clean of <em>Fallout 3 </em>and <em>New Vegas</em>, even <em>Shelter</em>. Blank slates. I have a mission from the Overseer: find a water chip, save the Vault. I exit the Vault and see a bunch of rats. I’m not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 2: </strong>Rats kill me for the third time. I haven’t saved and have to restart the game each time. It’s harder than I thought. I keep on expecting to live and beat rats but the rats are no joke. Video games aren’t hard. Leigh says, <em>You’ve been cursing a lot</em>. She’s looking at me with her big green eyes. She can’t enjoy <em>House Hunters</em> because of my shits and fucks and asshole-goddamnit. I apologize and click out of the game. I need to shower anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 1b: </strong>A few days later, a writing day. Rain outside. Leigh is at work. I load <em>Fallout </em>again. I spend time on the controls this time, reading the Help file, trying to understand the point-and-click interface of a mouse. I miss a controller. I’ve never not used a controller.</p>
<p>Though I’ve been playing video games for thirty years, computers were never my venue of choice. I had an Atari, then an NES, then a SNES and then PS, PS2 and PS3. I’ve played Xbox and GameCube and Wii. Computers were never the venue for games for me (with the exception of <em>Civilization)</em>; computers were for email and writing and internet dating.</p>
<p>When I’m satisfied with the help file, I press play.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 2b:</strong> Outside of the Vault, there’s a corpse on the ground. This time, I right-click with the mouse and realize I can loot a body. There’s weapons, stimpacks. I see I have equipment that I can load. I click around on the screen before the rats attack. I’m already learning.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 3b: </strong>I’ve triumphed over the rats and I make a save file. I don’t name it. Who needs naming conventions? When Leigh is on her way home, I’ll tell her of my glorious victory. I’m no longer concerned about the challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 4b</strong>: Later that night. Leigh is unimpressed with my success and asks about dinner. I tell her it will be ready when she gets home. We hang up and I get back to it. I’m supposed to find another Vault and get a water chip. It’s to the west on the simple map. 1997 was a more modesttime, graphically speaking. I click on the far west and the map slowly opens up as my little icon moves. Nothing happens as I travel by a location and keep on going. This is not what I intended, but I don’t know how to stop it. But maybe everything’s fine. I uncover a new location. But I’m ambushed before I reach it. The screen flickers and I’m on a map. There are bandits. They move first and blow my head off. That was quick.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 5b: </strong>Reload. I go to the other location. It’s a town full of desert sand and buildings and bookshelves. I click around. I discover a side quest and accept it. I have beaten rats, what are radscorpions? I have a gun. I have confidence. I save.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 6b:</strong> So much failure. Reload. Die. Reload. Die. Reload. Die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1x: </strong>In kindergarten, you have a spelling test. You’ve forgotten about it. You’ve never been good with remembering specific dates. Now you write everything down; as a 5-year old, you did not have that ability. But while discussing the problem with a classmate, you say, <em>Oh. The teacher gave us the list</em>, <em>I’ll use that</em> and you pull it from your backpack. The classmate shakes his head but you don’t notice and you happily copy the lessons. You remember it well. You had long blond hair that hung past your eyes and you had to brush it away. The blond hair disappeared when you hit puberty. This memory never did and never will. The teacher comes to you and takes the paper away. She says you’re cheating. I don’t know what cheating is. She says I’m being bad and that copying is against the rules. you say I didn’t know. She doesn’t believe you. You say I won’t do it again. She gives you a 0 for the quiz and you cry, but you remember that copying is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 1c: </strong>I restart again. It’s a rainy night and Leigh is in the other room poring over taxes. I’m on the couch. I hear her mumbling, occasionally cursing. I don’t let it bother me. I choose different starting traits to give me an advantage. I’ve since gone to message boards and deduced what I’ve done wrong. <em>Fallout</em> is malleable. I can be what I want to be. Some choices are worse than others, but none are game-breaking.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 2c: </strong>I get to the desert town, Shady Sands. I find a friend in a leather jacket. I convince him to join. Ian makes all the difference and the radscorpions go byebye.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 3c: </strong>We go to the Vault. It seems easier. I’m happy. The companion makes all the different. This game isn’t hard. I’ve learned lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 4c:</strong> I return to Shady Sands. I want to buy things. I’m told a woman is kidnapped by bandits. Will I help? Of course I will. Ian and I travel to the bandits, the Khans. We will rescue the woman.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 5c: </strong>The bandits are south. We travel, ambushed on the way by bandits. We fight and win. I loot their bodies. I am very good at this game.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 6c: </strong>The Khans are the bandits. They live in a shanty town and an old building. They have sex slaves. There are many bandits. We’re told to holster our weapons. I talk to their leader. He gives me guff and I tell him to shove it. He shoots my face off in one attack. I realize I forgot to save. I curse, loudly, and shut off the computer. <em>Shhhh,</em> Leigh says. She’s doing taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 7c: </strong> Reload. I repeat all my steps. It goes quicker every time. I find the Khans. I attack outside, starting in the shantytown. I kill many Khans. My companion is hurt and starts to run away. I continue shooting. I die shooting. I forgot to save again.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 8c: </strong>Reload. SAVE. Repeat. Die. Shut off the computer. Still grumpy, but at least I saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2x: </strong>You’re in 5<sup>th</sup> grade. You’ve just watched <em>Jungle Fever </em>because your parents left it in the VCR. There is a new curse word. You like curse words; you’re a very awkward kid. you read too much, you play chess, you play video games. Your classmates don’t have much to talk to you about. But you know curse words that they don’t. Your father, when he doesn’t know you’re around, is free with his mouth. You try out the words when you take baths, speaking them under water: <em>bitch, fuck, ass, cunt</em>. At school, whenever you learn a new one, you share with your friends. Most of your friends in elementary school are black. It’s a mostly black school. You decide to share this new one that you learned from <em>Jungle Fever.</em> It’s a Spike Lee movie, though that means little to you at the time. You try out the new word. My black friend, Mark, reacts. He has a high top fade that his hand goes to in shock. His eyes are wide. He grabs your arm and says, <em>what did you just call me?</em> You shake your head and deny everything. You learn that there are words not to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 1d: </strong>I start over. It’s the weekend. Still rainy. It’s rained for a week. Leigh is still doing taxes. Last year I offered to help. The year before I offered to help. This year I haven’t and don’t plan on it, but I’m there, available. She talks to me occasionally as I fly through the rats (<em>how much did you make writing?</em> she asks).  I fly through Shady Sands (<em>did you keep receipts of your business lunches?)</em>. I fly through the Vault (<em>did you edit that novel this year or last?)</em>. I skip the Khans (<em>aren’t you done playing?)</em>. I save.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 5d: </strong>Leigh wants to take a break from taxes. I’m much further in. I’m attacked by a mob boss of some kind when I’m trying to get a confession. I have to fight him. My companion fires and before I can move, a dog attacks. But not me. Where did the dog come from? I don’t remember getting him. The mob boss dies and I click on the dog. “The dog appears to be following you,” is all the game says. I scroll up in the text box and see that the dog is named Dogmeat. <em>Welcome aboard</em>, I mutter. I save. I tell Leigh that I can take a break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3x: </strong>Middle school is difficult. You do not know what to say. You never know what to say. You’re in Spanish class and everyone names music they like en Espanol. Yo quiero Guns and Roses. Yo quiero Salt-n-Pepa. Yo quiero Public Enemy. You are terrified. People have already said the only stuff you know. You don’t listen to music. Your mother has the <em>Top Gun</em> soundtrack. Your brother listens to Biohazard. Are either of those cool? You don’t know. When it’s your turn and you say, without thinking or planning, Yo quiero Debbie Gibson. Everyone laughs. Cheeks burning, you hide behind a strained grin. You think, <em>no, no, no, that was the wrong answer</em>. Months later, someone asks you what you listen to and you say, <em>Guns and Roses and Public Enemy. </em>That summer, you buy tapes of bands you’ve heard of. You will learn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 6d: </strong>I continue traveling the board. I find the Necropolis and the Boneyard. I discover the Cathedral. I see the Brotherhood. I travel to some of these places. I die frequently. I find locked doors I can’t pass. I leave and travel more. There is a timer that is ticking and sometimes when I travel too many days for no reason, I reload.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 10d:</strong> I reload after an enormous monster eats me in a cave. It’s a Deathclaw. I’m not ready to be there. I save right before trying again, this time in a new save slot. There’s reasons there are 10. The designers must have known they were making a difficult game. They gave us options. When I die again, I don’t panic.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 11d: </strong>I reload. I don’t try to kill the Deathclaw. I go elsewhere. It’s a big world. I’ll check out the Boneyard. I’ll level up. There are other ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4x. </strong>You’re in high school. Junior year. There’s a girl you like. She’s short and a troublemaker. She was kicked out of her school for drugs, but not the bad ones. You start to talk. Eventually she asks about sex. You lie and tell her you’re a virgin. She tells you she’s one too. She tells you she wants to have sex, but she wants to wait and that she hates oral sex. You tell her you really want oral sex. She asks if that’s a deal breaker and you say that you don’t know, maybe? She stops talking to you. You realize that you lied about the wrong things.</p>
<p><strong>5x: </strong>You’re in high school. Senior year. There’s a girl you think is gay. She says she’s not and she flirts with you. You start going out, only for a week. You hold hands a lot and kiss. You tell her you like her a lot. She tells you she thinks she’s gay. You think, there’s a lesson to be learned from this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 15d: </strong>Leigh is tired of me playing <em>Fallout </em>on the couch beside her. She’s worried about my eyes. I’m hunched over the computer, playing, staring. I tell her that I’m doing research. She says she knows. I ask her if she wants me to stop. She says no.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 16d</strong>: Leigh is doing taxes on the dining room table. I ask her if she wants anything. She asks if I can hang out with her instead of playing <em>Fallout</em> and just sit by her. I save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6x: </strong>You sophomore year of college, a girl with pretty blue eyes asks what you like and you tell her, <em>I like</em> <em>Dragonball Z</em>. She comes over to watch it and when it’s over, she says she’ll call in a couple days. You run into her three weeks later and she hugs you and moves on quickly.</p>
<p><strong>7x: </strong>Later in the semester, you get along well with a long-haired dude in your Philosophy class. Over a cigarette, he talks about his Dungeons and Dragons campaign. He’s an orc. You nod and smile and think,<em> god, what a tool</em>. You sit in a different seat the next class.</p>
<p><strong>8x: </strong><em>Oh</em>, you mumble out loud a few days later, when you see the girl. <em>I see the connection now.</em> It’s too late though, for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 20d: </strong>I have a large party. There’s Tycho and Katja, along with Dogmeat and Ian. They’re my friends. We fight monsters and raiders. I go to fight the Deathclaw Queen, now that I’m strong enough to kill it. And I do. But Tycho dies. Reload. I die. Reload. Dogmeat dies. Reload. Tycho dies. Reload.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 21d:</strong> I meet Super Mutants in the wasteland. They kill Dogmeat. Reload. Deathclaw Queen. Dogmeat dies. Reload.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 22d: </strong>Leigh asks me, before we go for a walk, why I’m so frustrated. <em>Because I can’t save my friends. </em>She shakes her head and we walk around the block. The flowers in our flowerbed are beginning to bloom. The wind is crisp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9x: </strong>You’re in AmeriCorps, in Denver, in a Wal-Mart with half-a-dozen others. You’ve been chatting with a dude who’s amusing. He starts talking about video games. You begin to respond, but see that the other four, who are all women, are rolling their eyes. You decide to not respond, but to end the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>10x: </strong>You’re almost out of AmeriCorps. You’re interviewing for a job. They ask you what your weaknesses are. You tell them that you’re insecure and that you get mad easily. You do not get the job and you think, <em>well, I know what to say next time. </em></p>
<p><strong>11x: </strong>The girl you’re dating goes into the hospital and you forget to call her. She tells you she doesn’t want to see you because you obviously don’t care. You apologize and she forgives you, but she ends it a week later. You promise yourself you will never forget again.</p>
<p><strong>12x: </strong>You don’t call your boss when you’re not coming into work. You get fired. You know what not to do.</p>
<p><strong>13x: </strong>Don’t tell your cool new friend that you live with your parents.</p>
<p><strong>14x: </strong>Buy clothes that fit.</p>
<p><strong>15x:</strong> Dead baby jokes are not for every audience.</p>
<p><strong>16x: </strong>Don’t say you’re a writer if you’re not writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 23d: </strong>I accidentally trigger the endgame and die and die and die. Reload and reload and reload. I can’t escape because I die. I can’t advance because I die. I have another save. Sigh and tell Leigh you won’t have dinner ready. You’re coming up on a deadline. <em>Want me to pick up pizza?</em> she asks.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 20d</strong>: I fire Ian and Tycho and Katja. I don’t want them to keep on dying. I can’t fire Dogmeat. I try.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 21d:</strong> Fight the Deathclaw Queen. Dogmeat lives.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 22d: </strong>Liberate Adytum. Dogmeat lives.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 23d: </strong>Encounter super mutants. Dogmeat dies. Reload. Dogmeat dies. Reload. Dogmeat dies. Reload. Dogmeat dies.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 26d: </strong>Trigger the first part of the endgame. Leigh says, “It’s late. Don’t you have work?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17x: </strong>Don’t stay up late when you have a conference the next morning.</p>
<p><strong>18x: </strong>Real jobs aren’t like AmeriCorps. You can’t hug everyone.</p>
<p><strong>19x:</strong> You can’t trust everyone to not break your heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hour 28d: </strong>Leigh is watching <em>House Hunters</em>. It’s a lovely Spring day. I’ve been at three work conferences, a writing conference, an interview, a funeral, two coffee dates, the doctor’s. I’ve canceled plans with my father, with a friend. I have to fit in a run. I have to clean the house. I have to do laundry. I boot up <em>Fallout.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hour 29d: </strong>The Super Mutants are no match for me. I can’t figure out force fields. What do I do? I look at the time. It’s so late. I’m so tired. Tomorrow is Monday and I have so many deadlines. Leigh is tired and watching <em>House Hunters</em>. I google “Mariposa Military Base.” I see how to lower the force fields. It’s a small compromise.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 30d:</strong> <em>House Hunters </em>is over. Leigh is asleep on the chaise. I travel to the Cathedral.</p>
<p><strong>Hour 31d: </strong>The Master is the end boss. He kills me. I reload. He kills me. I reload. I join him and watch the ending animation. I reload. He kills me. I reload. I kill him. I watch the ending animation. I pick Leigh up and carry her to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>20x: </strong>You’re an adult now, or close enough anyway. When you meet someone new—which is often enough—there are hundreds of lessons to go through exhaustively. You know others do it as well, lessons they’ve internalized. You still have to remind yourself of how to speak, how to talk, how to behave. It’s not easy for you. You have most fooled into thinking you’re well-adjusted, and who’s to say you aren’t? You’ve reloaded often enough.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the Battle of Hoover Dam (Part Deux), ED-E floats behind me while I navigate the ramparts and depths of the dam, exchanging fire with the forces of Caesar’s Legion in their throwback regalia. Arcade follows as well, lugging around a giant bludgeon as effectively as one expects a pacifistic surgeon to do. He often falls unconscious.</p>
<p>After activating an army of killer robots to help liberate New Vegas from both the New California Republic and the Legion, I go to fight the remnants of both armies. The Legate and his fist-punching hordes put up a fight, incapacitating both of my companions, but I’m <strong>Annie Blacktop</strong>—I don’t really need their help. I rain hell on the Legate until he explodes.</p>
<p>When my companions revive, I head to the gate. A representative of the NCR is there. There are options of peace I scroll through, but I can’t take his bad attitude. Even though he’s surrounded by an army, he talks trash to me, personally blaming me for all the mayhem. After I’ve taken enough of his abuse, I shoot him in the face with the Rat Slayer, because I hate him. His head explodes in a spray of blood and, presumably, bone and brain. His men open fire and are immediately Swiss-cheesed by the army of robots surrounding them. I don’t even get to take aim. I admittedly feel some guilt, since the grunts did nothing particularly wrong.</p>
<p>The credits roll. It turns out I’m not a savior. I’m not a tyrant. New Vegas rolls on without me and I’m just kind of there. That seems about right. There is little sense of accomplishment because I don’t seem to care. My head hurts and my stomach aches and I have the feeling I’ve made a mistake. I should have listened to Leigh and Greg.</p>

<hr />
<p>I’m not someone for whom moderation comes easily. I eat too many slices of pizza; when I watch television, I binge-watch seasons of <em>Buffy</em> or <em>Arrested Development</em>; I run too far (and hurt myself); I drink too much coffee/beer/water; I take on too much responsibility; I commit to too many celebrations. It’s a problem in everyday life that gets exacerbated when I fall in love.</p>
<p>My first love was with Twix. Twix, to those who live in caves, are twin bars of chocolate plus caramel goodness. I got them for the first time while trick-or-treating in 1988 (I was dressed as Link from <em>The Legend of Zelda)</em>. At the first bite, I knew there was something special. The crunch, the gooiness, the flavor sensation. I’d never experienced anything like it. I had to have more.</p>
<p>I ransacked my bag for all the Twix I could find and then traded with my older brother for all the Twix he had (at usurious rates). When I finished, I piled all of my Twix in front of me. My memory indicates I had dozens of pieces; most likely I had ten or so. Regardless, I was prepared to eat when my mother walked in and said, “Don’t even think about eating all of that. You’ll make yourself sick.”</p>
<p>She must have intended to teach me a lesson, because she in no way enforced her command and I proceeded to force every stick of chocolate down my gullet in a frenzy. When I was finished, my mouth was covered in chocolate and my stomach bulged slightly. I wish my contentment had lasted longer, because no sooner did I finish than I bounced up, rushed to the bathroom and vomited everywhere.</p>
<p>Never again, I vowed. Of course, that lasted until the next obsession came along. Because, again: moderation really isn’t my thing. I get occupied, enamored, obsessed. In my teens, I discovered pot and spent the better part of a decade stoned. Just last year I spent several months buying and selling <em>GI Joe</em> figures from the mid-‘90s for no particular reason. When I discovered fantasy football in 2010, I spent dozens of hours a week poring over the waiver and reading essays and articles about how to win. I had a few years where I <em>really liked ties</em> and I now have a collection of several dozen (of which I wear five or six regularly still).</p>
<p>There’s often a penalty to this lack of moderation. Sometimes it’s as simple as throwing up too many Twix. Not a big deal in the scheme of things: twenty-eight years later, I still enjoy the occasional Twix. But sometimes the obsession has a touch of ruination. I played it out (like pot, or <em>GI Joe</em>).</p>
<p>Which brings me back to <em>Fallout: New Vegas,</em> a wonderful game that I’ll hear no argument against. The design is a small step up from <em>Fallout 3</em>, but a step up nonetheless. The colors, when not traversing the Mojave Wasteland itself (full of browns and browns and browns), are crisp and sweet, the controls responsive and intuitive. Crows fly at regular intervals. Water gurgles. It’s often quite lovely.</p>
<p>There’s dark humor and overt sexuality, sometimes combined. For example, when recruiting three prostitutes for a bar, I came upon a robot that I needed to reprogram as a sexbot. My avatar is a paladin-kinda gal, but when the option came up to “test it out,” I said yes, figuring that no one was around, so… I might not have expected much, but I really didn’t expect the screen to go dark, nor the weird drilling sounds that followed. A new notch on Ms. Blacktop’s bedpost, I suppose.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4.jpg" alt="NV_4" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4.jpg 800w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>The challenge is there this time as well. No longer is my avatar a God-person, dispensing total death with reckless disregard for safety. A well-armed room of grunts have killed me quick. So have the Deathclaws that roam the abandoned Sloan Quarry. The Legion assassins that pop up periodically have good aim and know what’s up. In sum, there’s plenty to keep my trigger finger active and keep me on my toes. It’s not difficult, per se, but it’s not a cakewalk.</p>
<p>There’s tons of quests, too. The big letters appear at regular intervals and announce the next mission: <strong>The Legend of the Star</strong>; <strong>That Lucky Old Sun</strong>; <strong>Young Hearts.</strong> Each one that arrives gives me a little Skinner Box thrill and makes me grin. I’m task-oriented—a lot of us are. There’s that sparkle that comes when we make a list and when we check items off that list.</p>
<p>Companions are easy to find, just challenging enough to recruit, and immortal to boot. No more reloading. They’re helpful, but not game-changers. They have their own story that can be unlocked. Fantastic. They could have thrown in a black or Hispanic ally, maybe, but from a gameplay standpoint, I don’t have any complaints.</p>
<p>There are factions to choose from in the world of New Vegas: Do we choose to ally with the Legion, which wants to bring order to the world at the cost of slavery and rampant, disgusting misogyny (spoiler: no), or do we want to ally with the NCR, who are good-intentioned, if a bit dumb? Or do we go lone-wolf? Or do we ally with the immortal floating head? We can only pick one. I try to join the Brotherhood of Steel, pacify the Great Khans, embrace the philosophies of the Children of the Apocalypse, befriend the Boomers, keep the Caesar’s Legion happy, join the NCR and even be chill with the Powder Gangers after I murder a prison full of them. Ms. Blacktop really is my avatar; she just wants people to like her.</p>
<p>My goal by the end game is a free state of Las Vegas, but that wasn’t always my goal; I’d initially wanted to become a part of the New California Republic, but I stopped short when they asked me to slaughter too many other tribes. The Great Khans? They sell the <em>Fallout </em>version of meth and crack, so I executed the entire Red Rock Canyon of them. But the Brotherhood? They ain’t never did nothing to me. Who was I going to execute next? The Boomers up on the remnants of their air force base? The Goodsprings community who offended no one but western cliché standards? Sorry, NCR, you have to go now.</p>
<p>The choice of alliance is the story of <em>New Vegas. </em>There’s some rigmarole of a platinum chip and <em>blah blah blah who cares</em>, but really, it’s about the fate of Vegas. It’s macro and grand, without being personal. It’s intricate for intricacy’s sake. There’s an intellectual, <em>I’m playing a game</em> sense of fun in pitting the sides against the other. It’s novel. It’s exciting. It’s kind of hollow. But it’s not the fault of <em>New Vegas.</em></p>
<p>The memory of <em>Fallout 3</em> and the magic that arose for me while exploring the Capital Wasteland was too immediate. I <strong>was</strong> Vanessa Rutledge in a way that I’m <strong>not</strong> Annie Blacktop. Part of that is the difference between political intrigue and the connection between a father and his child. But the other part is contextual and purely a part of me.</p>
<p>It’s no one’s fault except maybe mine. Leigh and Greg both warned me, in their own ways. When I finished <em>Fallout 3</em>, I talked to Greg. He’s recently married, more recently made a father, but he’s always available to talk nerd and is quite the gamer, even if he’s recently slowed down. I asked him his thoughts on <em>New Vegas</em>. I expected him to hold forth, but he just shook his head. “Why would I play it?” he asked. “I loved the first one so much, how could I expect it to be as good?”</p>
<p>“Everyone says it’s amazing,” I said.</p>
<p>He shrugged. “What if it’s not? Will that ruin it for me? I’d rather not risk it.”</p>
<p>Discomfited, I asked Leigh about it a few days later. Not that she’s a gamer, but she at least knows me.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you just finish the other one?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Well … yeah. So?”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and continued washing the dishes. “I don’t know. Don’t you want to try something else? You’re just in one of your phases.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have phases,” I say, knowing full well that I do.</p>
<p>A few days later, I naysayed their nayseyery and ordered <em>New Vegas </em>from Amazon. And hours after I received it, I fired it up. At first, all was bliss. But it wasn’t long before feelings of unease set in, much like it does after finishing the fifth slice of pizza in one sitting. And instead of stopping, I pushed through for another 100-something hours, sort of like (to finish the metaphor) if after that fifth slice of pizza, I went ahead and ordered three more large pizzas.</p>
<p>Trust me. The thirty-second slice of pizza tastes much worst than the fifth, even if, objectively, it’s made of the same ingredients.</p>
<p>There’s another parallel to ruining enjoyment. Back in the early ‘90s, I read a book called <em>Echoes of the Fourth Magic. </em> It was about a submarine that goes through the Bermuda Triangle and encounters adventures in a magical future. If that sounds dumb, it’s because it’s a terrible concept, written by a mediocre author. But as a middle schooler, it was truly novel and exciting. As an adult, I remembered that book, hunted it down at the library and settled in to read during the first hour of a blizzard. Not an hour had passed before I put it down and sighed. I finished it, but only because I had no other books. It was awful: poorly plotted, had clumsy, adverb-filled prose, scant character development, and was filled with cliché. It was so bad that it <em>tainted my memory of the book.</em></p>
<p><em>New Vegas</em> didn’t ruin my love for <em>Fallout 3</em> but my modest enjoyment of it had an unfortunate effect on my overall enthusiasm. Missed expectations and all. The double-whammy of overindulgence and the failure to live up to the highest possible standards plucked a heart string I would have preferred stayed unplucked. It’s so rare that, as an adult, I get so excited with a piece of entertainment that I want to drown myself in it, that when I’m disappointed, it feels extra keen. And I have no one to blame for it but myself.</p>
<hr />
<p>The thing about obsession is that, when the obsession wears off, damage has been done. Either to myself (re: cigarettes) or, somehow more insidious, to how I feel about the object <strong>of </strong>my obsession. It’s difficult for me to listen to Radiohead’s <em>The Bends</em> because I listened to it daily from ’00 – ’02. Similarly, it took me over a decade to sit down and replay <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> after I logged hundreds of hours back when it came out. I’ve hurt my appreciation to go back and enjoy something I’ve loved. And that is the tragedy of too much chocolate: you’re hurting your past self’s memories and your future self’s enjoyment and even your present self’s love.</p>
<p>Greg was right in his hesitation to play <em>New Vegas.</em> Not because it isn’t a stellar game (because it is a stellar game) but because he understood something about himself. He knew that if it wasn’t absolutely perfect, it would mess with a legacy he enjoyed. And Leigh was right to warn me to pace myself. She understands my tendency to burn my interests out with too much intensity.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1335" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1.jpg" alt="NV_1" width="670" height="419" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1.jpg 670w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></a></p>
<p>The thing about my obsessions is that they’re part of a never-ending cycle that has a tendency to hop tracks once in awhile. At the moment, I’m only obsessed with food, specifically bagels and lox. And I want to eat it for every meal. But, partially because I’m not much of a foodie, I’ve been able to withstand the full-blown temptation to indulge in it every chance I get. I’ll burn it out eventually, but it might take months instead of weeks (or even days). Because the other reason is that I’ve learned, at least a little, how to pace myself. I want to <strong>keep</strong> enjoying my bagels and lox, so I’m putting arbitrary limitations. I can only eat the ones I buy the ingredients for at the store; I can only eat one a week; I can only eat one after a large portion of vegetables. So far, it’s working.</p>
<p><em>Fallout 4</em> is officially released today. I want to play it so, so badly. But I won’t. For one, I still have an enormous backlog of PS3 games to play (<em>Mass Effect 2, </em>specifically, has been begging for me to plat it) and have no intention of buying a PS4 in the near future. But more importantly, I want to savor the experience. I’m going to wait until years have passed and my ache to play it has dissipated. And then, only when I have the time and the mental capacity will I plug it in and enjoy, once again, the wasteland.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fallout</strong></p>
<p>The screen says it’s simple: one button<br />
and every bit gets flushed from memory.</p>
<p>How many polygons does it take<br />
to build all those dead bodies?</p>
<p>How long before the blue screen<br />
says forget about the bomb?</p>
<p>Ghosts turn away<br />
when we look them in the eye</p>
<p>which presents the question<br />
these games can’t answer:</p>
<p>Who are we to say<br />
this place needs saving?</p>
<p>Maybe we give in<br />
to the sounds of Bob Crosby,</p>
<p>grind the polycarbonate<br />
into piles of plastic dust,</p>
<p>raise the warm mounds<br />
to our mouth and blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kirby of the Stars</strong></p>
<p>Last night my mother died<br />
in my dreams. I went on</p>
<p>kicking piles of snow into televisions,<br />
inhaling bombs, throwing apples at oak trees.</p>
<p>In my bedroom I hang<br />
myself some reminders:</p>
<p>A broken star rod.<br />
A fountain filled with hammers.</p>
<p>I only know how to be other people<br />
by pulling them inside myself.</p>
<p>I turn into a tornado,<br />
blow through a megaphone.</p>
<p>It’s Christmas and I remember<br />
her saying time is a flat circle,</p>
<p>and stars are just burning balls of hydrogen<br />
that expire before you can see them.</p>
<p>When I wake up, I’ll turn all my clocks into triangles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;GET LAMP</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<em>look</em><br />
you are standing<br />
in an open field.<br />
north of a house<br />
with a boarded front door.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>open mailbox</em><br />
your finger thumbs<br />
an orange leaflet.<br />
Eviction the only word<br />
you read. The rest forgotten.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go south </em><br />
you are behind<br />
a broken window.<br />
enough to slip in.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>enter window</em><br />
inside: stale popcorn,<br />
candle wax crusted over<br />
an oriental carpet.<br />
under the wooden table:<br />
a sword.<br />
a brass lamp.<br />
a cellar door.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>get lamp and sword</em><br />
you’re left heavy<br />
raising the scabbard<br />
while your other hand holds<br />
the lamp waiting for kerosene.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go down</em><br />
a staircase descends<br />
into a dark basement.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>look</em><br />
you can barely see<br />
through the dark<br />
the boxes of baseball cards<br />
a pink panther action figure</p>
<p>&gt;<em>ignite lamp</em><br />
ignite is not a verb that’s recognized.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>kill with sword</em><br />
there is nothing<br />
to kill.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>kill with sword</em><br />
there is nothing<br />
to kill.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go back</em><br />
you can’t<br />
go that way.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go home</em><br />
you can’t<br />
see any such thing.</p>
