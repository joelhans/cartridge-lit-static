								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Benjamin Kinney lives and writes in Marquette, Michigan, where he earned an M.A. in English from Northern Michigan University. Prior to that, he was a middle school teacher in the Tampa area. He has published reviews on the  </em>Ploughshares<em> blog and  </em>Heavy Feather Review<em>, and nonfiction in </em>Walloon Writers Review<em>. He has an infrequently updated blog at <a href="http://benjaminkinney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benjaminkinney.com</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>His story, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/words-fail-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Words Fail Him,”</a> appeared in our </em> Next Gen <em>Temple Issue. Below, he talks with editor William Hoffacker about brevity, RPGs, spending money, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Why did you choose </em></strong><strong>Chrono Trigger<em> as a subject for fiction? What special qualities does this game have that inspired your writing?</em></strong></p>
<p>From the first time I played it (and I’ve played it like fifteen times now), I cared deeply about the heroes and felt like their world was an actual place where the non-playable characters went about their lives even when I wasn’t looking. The time travel element made the world seem limitless. At the same time, the game only takes 20-30 hours to complete, and at some point the player is flying the airship around and realizing they’ve done everything they can possibly do in the game—that nothing new remains. For a game this beautiful, this realization is hard-hitting, and my piece was inspired by the desire to hang out there a little longer.</p>
<p><strong><em>I admire how many specific, world-evoking details are packed into a compact space in your piece. Do you normally work in such a short form? What are the challenges of achieving this economy of language?</em></strong></p>
<p>Aww, thanks! I tend to be long-winded, so this piece was an anomaly. In my M.A. program at Northern Michigan University, we had a lot of faculty who stressed economy of words—I took a workshop with Matthew Gavin Frank, and he could spend an hour critiquing one paragraph of an essay. NMU was where I began to always ask the question, “Is this word or sentence helping the piece?” Even though I write mostly longer stuff, my final drafts tend to be about thirty percent shorter than early drafts. My biggest fear in writing this way is that some of my voice—and even some of my message—gets lost. I want to believe that there’s a place somewhere for all my adverbs and random asides, but I’m starting to fear that there isn’t.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beyond </em></strong><strong>Chrono Trigger<em>, what is your history with video games? Any favorites you care to mention? Do you play often?</em></strong></p>
<p>Gaming was a formative part of my childhood. I have a brother who is five years older than me, and when I was in kindergarten I would sit on his bed and watch him play <em>Final Fantasy VI </em>on the Super Nintendo. I believe my early interest in RPGs is the reason I’m so interested in narratives to this day. I must have played every RPG on the Super Nintendo, and I gamed almost daily throughout high school and college. My favorite games are <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and <em>VII </em>and <em>Secret of Evermore. </em>I think about certain things differently because I played so many video games. The <em>Harvest Moon </em>games influenced how I conceptualize life in general and especially making and spending money, a topic I’m still obsessed with today. Every time I do anything even remotely adventurous, I pretend I’m Lara Croft from <em>Tomb Raider.</em> When I graduated from college, I stopped playing as often, though about one game a year still catches my interest. Just a few days ago I bought a PS4, so I might be reentering a period of playing frequently.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any genre, any scale, with no limitations), what work would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think Stephen King’s <em>Dark Tower </em>series would make an excellent RPG—it has a memorable cast of characters, a classic quest, and plenty of villains. Hell, it’s pretty similar to the <em>Wild Arms </em>games for the Playstation and PS2. I love games where I can level grind and where the main storyline never gets inundated with a bunch of side crap, so if the game fit those criteria (and if Oy was a fully playable character), I’d be happy. I haven’t seen the <em>Dark Tower </em>movie, but a lot of my friends hated it, so somebody just needs to tell Stephen King that the truest adaptation of this work is a video game!</p>
<p><strong><em>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</em></strong></p>
<p>I have a ton of new ideas that I’m always starting and then abandoning, and for the past few years I have been writing fiction and nonfiction equally. But one project that has stuck with me for about a year now is a novel about, basically, how we spend money and how that comes to define who we are. The idea was partially inspired by video games. Spending all my “leveling up” points or what have you in RPGs is always really stressful for me—what if I spend all my ability points in pursuit of becoming a self that, in retrospect, I don’t like very much? (This is an issue that plagues me in life as well. I’m gradually coming to terms with the fact that I’ll never do or own exactly what I want.)</p>
<p><strong><em>What have you read and/or played recently that you want to recommend?</em></strong></p>
<p>I reread Roberto Bolano’s <em>The Savage Detectives </em>this summer. It’s such an intricate, detailed novel, and I have a weird feeling that one of the deep truths of the universe is hidden somewhere in its pages—someone smarter than me just needs to tell me what it is. It is a great example of a work that manages to be long and complex without any part of it feeling unnecessary. A friend also turned me on to Blake Bulter’s <em>There Is No Year</em> with the promise that Butler was a lot like David Lynch (my favorite director), and I’m midway through the novel and loving it.</p>
<p>Last year I played <em>Undertale </em>on my computer, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. The world needs more great small-scale games, and <em>Undertale </em>delivers both with gameplay and story. I would say a game’s story is even more important than its gameplay, and <em>Undertale </em>seems to understand that. Also, I’ve just started <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>. It has a sense of light-heartedness and fun that the previous few installments have sadly lacked, and there is this delicious homoeroticism going on between all the male characters. And having not gamed for a while, I’m floored by how beautiful graphics are in 2017. I was used to playing my old PlayStation games and trying to figure out what half the polygons and sprites were supposed to be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the dawning of a new millennium, Marle, but so many small things happen less frequently. I’ve been trying to find the right way to say this: these small things are so big, and the world is so small.</p>
<p>Can we stay here forever with Gato who has metal joints, and if we beat him up, we earn fifteen silver points? The silver points are so pretty, and Gato never punches too hard. He would never tell us, but if we leave he has nobody to play with. Marle, we once saw Gato’s rusted husk on a pile of wreckage, it and us and the world beaten up beyond repair, and we cried. Polluted dust flew into our eyes, and we were so hungry.</p>
<p>My only other friend here is a girl named Lucca, and she has already amazed me with what she can build from scraps. Can we just own cats, Marle? Can we visit the inn whenever we get bored, and can we hope that Lucca someday invents something to solve your ennui?</p>
<p>Marle, deep below us are monsters that feast insatiably on the world’s worst truths. There are abysses you can walk in and never be sure that the you that walks out is really you. And I hate to say it, but the treasures in the world’s crevices are no more beautiful than these woods and the tolling of the bell in this courtyard. And Marle, I know your father is a pain, but he loves you as much as he knows how. We can live a life that never forces him to think things that destroy him. Kids are playing in this square. There is cotton candy and all the soda you can drink.</p>
<p>We can sculpt our bodies together, and after years of beating up Gato we can boast that we could kill anything that ever existed, but instead we can stay in bed until we are woken by sunlight and crowing roosters. There is something heroic in that. I know how the world beckons, but there have been paths through the earth’s remote corners for sixty-five million years. Love, Marle, is the road least traveled. I know how disappointing this is, and I know you’ve lost something, but we’ve all lost something we’ll never find.</p>
<p>Marle, can we stay here and admire these bright costumes? Can we eat candy? Can we feel this breeze and pretend we are flying birds?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>A note: This isn’t really a review, so to speak, because the idea of writing a legitimate review is terrifying to me. This is more “thoughts on” rather than “meaningful criticism.” We’re all talking about video games, here, so there has to be at least a little room for just having fun with things.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> * * *</p>
<p>Unlike Michael P. Williams, author of <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/collections/books/products/chrono-trigger-by-michael-p-williams" target="_blank"><i>Chrono Trigger</i></a> (not the game, but the book, out now from <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/" target="_blank">Boss Fight Books</a>), I did not buy myself, or have someone buy for me, the Super Nintendo game of the same title. At the time the game was released, I had no video game systems to speak of, but a few friends did, and a few friends’ older brothers did go out and buy the exorbitantly-priced game with their allowances, which meant I was able to watch the game from a spectator’s seat between slices of pizza and Coke and skateboarding sessions out in the driveway.</p>
<p>In a way, I beat the game before ever guiding Crono a single step.</p>
<p>I bought my SNES and a handful of games—<i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Final Fantasy VI</i>, and <i>Earthbound</i>, the three games that many would say are the <i>magnum opi</i> of the 16-bit—for what I think was about sixty dollars. I bought it from one of those friends&#8217; older brothers, who said selling the system and those games was like “losing a friend.” But, apparently money was more important — so that he could buy a PlayStation, no doubt.</p>
<p>Unlike Williams, I had no magical experience, as Williams did, upon unsealing the game and turning on its power for the first time. I simply pulled mine from that cardboard box—the gray plastic already a little yellowed, the label&#8217;s edges frayed. I had no strategy guide, but I’d already spectated my way through the dungeons and key sequences. More than once heard my eight-year-old friends shout, “I did hit <i>L-A-R-A</i>, damn it!” I knew what I was doing. I was ready.</p>
<p>I always felt that my early experiences with <i>Chrono Trigger</i> were akin to watching the director’s commentary on a movie before watching the movie itself. I always felt that knowledge helped me understand the game better than my peers. But the delight in Williams’ new book is what I think of as the behind-the-scenes of that director’s commentary—insights on the game’s production in an angle that is uniquely his.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> * * *</p>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> is the second book in a series of video game-related books from Boss Fight Books. The first, <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/collections/books/products/earthbound-by-ken-baumann" target="_blank"><i>EarthBound</i></a>, by Ken Baumann, is divided into three &#8220;narratives&#8221;: reminiscing of playing the game with his older brother, a present-time replaying that coincides with a major illness, and general criticism. Williams takes a slightly different approach, favoring mostly criticism laced with his perspective on Japanese culture, race, sexuality, gender issues, and apocalypse.</p>
<p>Williams recounts his own time as a teacher at a Japanese school, and how largely strange and unique he was to the students. Japan, as he says, is largely a one-race country—although supposedly 1.5% of the nation is non-Japanese—and the world of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is very much the same, populated by “one global monorace, spanning all the way from prehistory to the dismal future of 2300 A.D.” That sense of Williams&#8217; otherness bleeds throughout the book, and reflects well in his criticism.</p>
<p>It turns out that the &#8220;monorace&#8221; decision was largely based on a desire for “an aesthetic commonly called <i>mukokuseki</i>, or ‘nationalitilessness.’” Essentially, a desire to remove Japanese cultural distinctions from games that would be sold on an international level. This helped to both make characters more “relatable” to Western audiences and prevent anything that might be seen as racially insensitive. Interlacing his own experiences as the “other” within that country, Williams starts to hit his stride, parsing Japanese history for reasons why the game’s designers made such exclusive decisions.</p>
<p>Williams handles gender and sexuality with the same type of appropriate and insightful balance between analysis of Japanese cultural norms and his own experiences as a gay man who was repeatedly interrogated by his students: “‘<i>Kanojo imasu ka?”’ Are you married? Do you have a girlfriend?”</i> For a culture so seemingly heteronormative, Williams points out that <i>Chrono Trigger</i> actually does a great deal of interesting things with gender and sexuality that my less-than-ten-year-old brain certainly didn’t process as spectator <i>or</i> player.</p>
<p>Crono and Marle are the standard straight white couple, yes, but there’s also some truly interesting analysis into Lucca’s possible <i>robosexual-ness</i>, and the fact that Frog might hold a closeted love for Cyrus behind all his <i>thy</i>s and <i>thou</i>s. Does Magnus have an insestual love toward his sister, Schala?</p>
<p>And what about Magus’ general Flea, who is identified repeatedly as male, but dresses as a woman, and attacks by kissing? Is one of Flea&#8217;s bits of dialog—“Male or female, what difference does it make? Power is beautiful, and I’ve got the power.”—a “queer anthem,” as Williams calls it? To help answer some of these questions, Williams brings in his knowledge of the complexities of the Japanese language, which, for example, has nearly a dozen options in pronouns. Flea uses <i>atai</i> whereas Frog uses <i>ore</i>, two male-oriented pronouns that have different, nuanced definitions to Japanese speakers. Naturally, that meaningful difference is rendered down into a single “he” in the American version. But if one were to play the game again, knowing this possibility, what new readings might they make from Flea&#8217;s attacks, or Frog&#8217;s regrets?</p>
<p>All of this is to say the book’s strongest point is analyzing the <i>what if</i>. The ways the game is very different between its Japanese and American incarnations, and the many ways they could have diverged still, given simple choices by the game’s translators. The ways Americans might reinvest themselves in the game if only they knew the nuances lost in translation.</p>
<p>And on those translations — the two interviews Williams has integrated into the book, the first with Ted Woolsey, the original translator for the SNES version, and the second with Tom Slattery, who translated the Nintendo DS version, are both remarkably compelling. Everything from impossible deadlines to boring cubicles to accidentally gendering a character that had been ambiguous for years—they prove just how difficult it is to carry all those nuances over from one side of the world to another. It&#8217;s sort of like time travel in the game itself—things get lost along the way, or skewed, and sometimes, it just doesn&#8217;t make all that much sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> * * *</p>
<p>The book did meander a bit, in my opinion, which kept me from truly engaging within its first 40 or so pages. At times it felt a little like a dungeon that was designed purposefully to confuse the player (reader) into taking wrong turns, circumnavigating through hallways already explored. I wondered at times if it wouldn’t have benefited from a little more insight from Williams’ unique perspective on Japanese culture rather than lengthy critiques of how the game’s time travel paradoxes don’t often make sense—as I said before, does time travel ever truly make sense?</p>
<p>And I’d hardly recommend the book to someone who wasn’t already familiar with Crono and his world-saving, Lavos-killing friends, although I don’t think Williams and Boss Fight Books are looking to publish books of generally-accessible criticism. This book is for gamers, those who grew up on the heyday of JRPGs, who hold dear places in their hearts for these 16-bit games. <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is a book, then, for those who want an excuse to play the game yet again. To dig up an old dusted-out cartridge or to scan some illegitimate-looking site for a ROM. To shell out a few bucks to play it on a smartphone or on a Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>In that light, the book definitely succeeds. The book makes me want to dig for the box I know contains my copy of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> and all its siblings. Makes me want to remember how to connect a Super Nintendo to a modern-day TV (the RF/antenna connector still works but remember how much you hate screwing them in!). Makes me want to slog through the first few hours of the game, which I’ve inevitably played more times than I can count, in order to find the gems I’ve forgotten.</p>
<p>Armed, then, to see the game differently. To consider Lucca’s sexuality, or the meaning of Crono&#8217;s silence and how that reflects on the game&#8217;s standard straight relationship with Marle. To think about the events that have happened between 1995 and today that some might think of as apocalyptic, and how that changes the tragedy of 1999 A.D. To think about the quirks in translation—do you know what the “Naga-ette Bromide” <i>really</i> is?—and to consider why the game’s creators made some characters men, and others women, and others between. To be a completely different kind of spectator.</p>
<p>Isn’t that what these books are all about? To not only remind us of why we love these games, and make us want to play them, but also to render them new again?</p>
