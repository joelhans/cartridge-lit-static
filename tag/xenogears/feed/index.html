								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Fighter of Nortune</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many versions of you can there be?<br />
Multi-million deals, virtual genealogies,<br />
monstrous Hollywood handprints,<br />
the aphasic on suicide missions.</p>
<p>In a discounted edition of the world,<br />
you lead the invasion.<br />
A three-hundred-million-year-<br />
old princess is offered as down payment —</p>
<p>your skin oozes its trademark phlegm.<br />
When was the last time the government<br />
loaned you a pair of corrective lenses<br />
to fight?</p>
<p>Like Samson, pull the pillars to the ground.<br />
But give the guests sufficient time to leave<br />
the rave. In red solitude<br />
the hero can adjust to his own reputation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jungian</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hogs commune in an open field<br />
to decide your fate.</p>
<p>The course of reincarnation<br />
is the reenactment of Cain’s decapitation<br />
of his brother’s flock<br />
because God — too — looks away.</p>
<p>The pigs mumble under their stitches.</p>
<p>Fei practices variations of punches<br />
on a board of Scrabble,</p>
<p>his two-dimensional frame rotating<br />
and rotating until parts of his innocence<br />
are sacrificed to the wild wiring</p>
<p>behind the television.</p>
<p>One god pulls a screw<br />
from his chest<br />
and offers it to his son,<br />
who wears it as an earring.</p>
<p>The hogs misbehave in pixels.</p>
<p>Even martyrs<br />
reject the thought of a comeback.</p>
