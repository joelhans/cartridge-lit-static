<p><strong>Self Portrait As A Pokémon Yellow Playthrough</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> Professor Oak asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.&nbsp;<br> You shrug &amp; check your<br> squirming pants. Yellow<br> ears pop out. Today,<br> gender is electric.&nbsp;<br> Stormy, even. Filled with<br> power.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Your rival asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.<br> You say, water gun.&nbsp;<br> You say, vine whip.<br> You say that you are<br> ember, slowly pulsing<br> across health bar like<br> alarms scrambling for potions.&nbsp;<br> Today, gender hasn&#8217;t<br> evolved yet. It&#8217;s growing<br> like a bulb, like a candle<br> inside a dragon&#8217;s cave.<br> Your rival stomps away,<br> says <em>smell ya later</em>. But&nbsp;<br> does&nbsp;gender smell? You&nbsp;<br> sniff your balls, all six<br> metallic red &amp; white<br> as scentless as the&nbsp;<br> Pokémon Center.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Misty asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl<br> &amp; you say just give me&nbsp;<br> the bloody badge.<br> Brock asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.&nbsp;<br> Actually he doesn’t;<br> you Nurse no Joy. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Team Rocket asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.<br> You unzip your fly &amp; out&nbsp;<br> floats a ring of Clefairy. Tonight,<br> gender is metronome, is spinning<br> star, is blasting the villains off<br> into space. Into their own business.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mewtwo asks you&nbsp;<br> if you are a boy or a girl<br> &amp; you say that you have trapped<br> legends in pills, swallowed myths<br> like candy, like tongue is wild<br> grass where monsters live.<br> You say that the gender of one&#8217;s<br> birth is irrelevant. Gender isn&#8217;t the<br> gift of life, but the wrapping paper<br> &amp; the bow. It&#8217;s the box inside the<br> PC, pixel deposits incubating in<br> cyberspace.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You ask Mewtwo<br> if they are a boy or a girl &amp;<br> they say &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;No.&#8221; </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>094.
Gengar</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Should you feel yourself
attacked by a sudden chill, it is evidence of an approaching Gengar. There is
no escaping it. Give up.&#8221; – Pokémon Moon</p>



<p>During the seventh lunar month, you must never turn your head back when the shadows call your name. They want to steal it. They want what comes with your name. Keep walking straight. Even if fog tickles your breath. Even if fingers brush against shoulders.</p>



<p>Yet in the day, they call you by a different name. The name drags its hair across gravel. The name chatters &amp; contorts. The name wears a thin white dress. The name drips across your spine like wax. The name tugs at your clothes with coffin-stained nails. Begs you to look it in the eye. It does not want offerings of incense or burnt Hell notes. Instead it is a <em>getai</em> song, constantly screaming in your head. Instead, they call you by a name you wish to forget, a corpse you haunt. They spin syllables that slither around your soul. When you turn around to answer, you feel the joss-sticks die. Your soul, a mote of ash in the wind. You answer the name that is not yours &amp; forget how to live. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>778.
Mimikyu</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;After going to all the effort of disguising itself, its neck was broken. Whatever is inside is probably unharmed, but it&#8217;s still feeling sad.&#8221; – Pokémon Sun</p>



<p>You are still trying to name
yourself, still scribbling on your tombstones, still threading through sutures.
You are partition &amp; parenthesis. You are still trying to remember your
myths, untangling knots of flesh &amp; fate. You are folklore &amp; family curse.
You self-exorcist.</p>



<p>When a man touches you, does he see a twinkling pixie, or a meat mannequin? What colour does he see in your irises? Whose voice does he hear? Which cheekbone catches the light? Will his impish smile lead to nowhere? Will his fascination fade at sunrise, like every other boy before him? Or will he want to store you in a jar? When the crypt of your neck cracks, will he flee from the mogwais within? What does he want from you? Your ghost-parts, your fairy-parts, or the parts that are neither?</p>



<p>The mirror stares back every day. You don’t know what shade you’re looking at. You don&#8217;t know how skin feels like. Only silk. Only chiffon. You don&#8217;t know how a man&#8217;s tongue tastes like. Does it lick like lace? You pull at the seams of your parts. You don’t know which part needs a cross-stitch. Maybe you need a lock of hair. Maybe you need the spell of someone else&#8217;s fingers. Maybe you’re fine with not knowing. </p>

<p><strong><em>(B)</em></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has always taught me to run<br> whether it be from a pokemon battle or an<br> unexpected visit from an actual bee’s noise.<br> i <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run up stairs</p>



<p> like i&#8217;m sure to see my father. &amp; i am not his,<br> just mine, &amp; my thick hair twists, once in, now,<br> just now, an unrivalled out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i barely<br> care about what he thinks about my hair,</p>



<p> the ones i love, the way i dress, the way i give love,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as i would barely,<br> remember my nintendo DS Lite. how it don&#8217;t<br> work no more ‘cause it had guillotined to<br> divorce right after the charger had broke.<br> i do remember<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Ranger, &amp; Platinum, &amp; Diamond,</em><br> riddled quiet in dusted cases; each<br> pokemon game &amp; cartridge i<br> had as all i had<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when<br> my father wasn&#8217;t there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; when my son,<br> <em>Mew</em>, reached level 100, i had made the best of<br> the hand &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Oak</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dealt me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Red, Ash, &nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;<br> Silver</em><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all dreamt my dream for a father<br> &amp; i remember how they all never spoke. &amp; i<br> remember whichever name you gave him</p>



<p> becoming the boy’s name. Silver’s mom got<br> running shoes from Silver’s dad.<br> Silver once bumped into a cave atop a mountain<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; then found him &#8211; Red,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at its precipice,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transforming into,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, just now, a Mew </p>



<p>&#8211; with its hair returned untethered &amp; to<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its original form; &amp; so mindful<br> a Mew, in fact, he did learn how to learn<br> any move so one<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be performed like a dance which<br> might serve, like a mating call, to summon<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a father who too &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;searches for father.</p>



<p> remember? that conflict with Mew. once led<br> ash’s heart to petrified stone in the stale air. &amp;<br> how diamond should sublimate to stale air,<br> a Pikachu’s tear once hauled Ash from his<br> cryogenesis, in fact, so well &#8211; Ash hasn&#8217;t aged<br> since, which implies Ash could die &amp; get born<br> again &amp; still have no father. we all remember</p>



<p> waking up alone &amp; to a new mother, saying<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>not a thing<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has changed, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not our father, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not<br> our mountains, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not Pokemon.”</em><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as fathers go unmentioned in the games<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until 2002, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my dad &amp; i still don&#8217;t talk.<br> i wonder about how much it has to do with</p>



<p> being a father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i go to capture<br> a moment’s truth &amp; stick it in poems<br> as trainers <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run to catch the Mewtwo<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with just pokeballs.<br> i hope Red had taken time to write his<br> requiem for his lost dad, when trainer<br> Silver, had happened<br> to find him praying at the mountain froth.</p>



<p> perhaps Red caught a cold &amp; this<br> father-poem needed to be about how cold &amp;<br> alone Red felt. maybe his throat<br> hurt too much to talk so Red fled the fight<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in hopes to get a healing with<br> his father. maybe it was less of a <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run &amp;<br> moreso <strong><em>(A)</em></strong> jump; that his father was just<br> a sky away. just now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run up stairs like i will<br> see my own. in the sky. from the top step<br> of mountains until i’m downstairs<br> with my single mother again.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weight of the controller increases. Playing becomes a Herculean effort. Muscles build in my chubby child hands, muscles I never knew I had, muscles developing from nowhere. I do this exercise in gaming weightlifting because I want to see on the big screen my Pokémon Game Boy games. <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>, specifically. I insert the Transfer Pak into the back of the Nintendo 64 controller. This heavy object serves as an emulator, enabling the two-dimensional goodness, the bland yet still strikingly vibrant colors of <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>, on the TV screen.</p>
<p>Something about the littleness of the Game Boy game blown up onto the TV makes me giddy. This game that is meant to be small, held in hand, framed within a screen the length of a finger, is reconfigured as something large. The square body of the female avatar is so much larger on the screen, where my budding sexuality, my femmeness, imagines in her step a pep, a sway, a femininity celebrated. I put the volume up as much as I remotely can to hear the iconic Pokémon music, each town and location its own score, thinking how lifelike, how grand it is journeying across this 8-bit world. The scale of Pokémon, otherwise tiny, otherwise contained between my two hands, on the big screen becomes something magical.</p>
<p>I spend entire summers playing <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Crystal </em>on the Nintendo 64 on my grandparents’ TV. It’s the only place where I can spend hours upon hours playing because in my home—well, not really my home but the rental, the cramped box we live in without any privacy, any moment to be with oneself—I have to share a TV with my brother, and the living room one is off limits. TV time is hard to come by, but in my grandparents’ house, a house where my abuelita babies me, I can have it for as long as I want. But these are just for the summers, or weekends. On most other days, my Game Boy allows me to clock in the hours upon hours of gameplay I otherwise cannot clock in at my own home. I can be in the backyard, in the woods, sitting on the porch steps. The world of Pokémon anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>In my grandparents’ house, I have a space all my own to game. I recline the chair as I want, I sit as up close as I want, I play as long as I want. I yell at the TV as loud as I need to, I throw the controller onto the couch as hard as I want, I can let my body respond to the games I play as I need it to. Something I cannot fully do in the cramped space of my parents’ house, with my shared bedroom, our shared living room, all the space I must share with so many others.</p>
<p>My grandparents’ living room is the closest thing I get to a gaming room. This kind of space is a luxury. Some of the other boys and girls in my school note how they have a game room, a special room with cool, expensive gaming chairs, the biggest screens and the best surround sound systems, all the latest consoles and equipment. They speak of these luxuries and I stay quiet, little me who comes from the Mexican part of town, the poor part of town, a neighborhood they call ghetto and dirty. They speak of their game rooms and I stay quiet, like always, like I will do for so many years because I idealize these little white children, their well-maintained neighborhoods, their big houses with game rooms. I feel intensely jealous of these boys and girls. Of the fact they have a designated space for gaming and leisure, a space carved out in the home to do what I can only do on special occasions at my grandparents’. A gaming room of their own.</p>
<p>Gaming is a form of solitude for my childhood self. A moment of respite from the antics of my family, a moment of escape from the white boys and girls I go to school with who call me fat, call me faggot, call me a dirty Mexican or a dirty Puerto Rican. That want that is being alone with oneself. We don’t frequently connect childhood with the desire for solitude. Children want to play with others, be with other children, have the attention of adults. Perhaps because I do not have my own room growing up, no space to call my own, and every Monday through Friday I experience a barrage of hatred from my classmates, at an early age I cultivate this need for solitude. A longing for an environment never had. A space in this world sectioned off just for me. For me and only me.</p>
<p>Video games give me this solitude. This being with myself. Though, like reading, this is a solitude that is not really solitude. I spend my time with my Pokémon, battling with them and healing them after, feeding them berries and giving them nicknames. It’s a form of connection, an intimacy with the unreal, a being with the incorporeal. In a world where I feel I don’t matter, where any day I can be gone and no one could care less, video games assure me that, in fact, I do matter, I am needed, my presence is essential. They—my Pokémon, my blue haired avatar, the NPCs, the storyline—need me.</p>
<p>The heaviness of the controller as I play in my grandparents’ house. The focus, the concentration, the joy. The weight in my hands is comfort. The controller’s increased dimensions, its bulkiness, the strain it demands, reminds me I am inside playing the game I often have to play outside. The game I fall in love with because it can be anywhere I take my body to, any exodus I undertake to keep on going. Here in this memory, this memory still so alive, for hours upon hours in this sunlight-soaked living room of my grandparents, screaming at the TV or gripping the controller tightly in frustration, the breeze through the front door and my grandmother cooking her rice and beans in the kitchen, is my gaming room. These memories at the turn of the century, this faraway childhood, my grandparents now gone, the closest I have ever gotten to a gaming room of my own.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a sentence that I never expected myself, or <em>anyone,</em> to write, but that is nonetheless true: <em>Pokémon Red</em> was too real for me.</p>
<p>This is not to say that it wasn’t a work of genius—outdated graphics, monotonous gameplay and all. The late 90s culture that it arrived in was awash in collection-based fads, most of which would play themselves out by the end of the decade. Pogs, Beanie Babies, Longaberger baskets (whose company headquarters, an office building in Dresden, Ohio shaped like a giant basket itself, currently sits abandoned, a testament to the era’s bizarre craze and excess), and others have long since ceased to be anything more than sources of ironic reminiscence for those of us who lived through their heyday. <em>Pokémon </em>and <em>Magic: the Gathering </em>are the only modern-day survivors of this proliferation to maintain their popularity over time, and for good reason.</p>
<p>What it came down to, especially in the case of <em>Pokémon, </em>was the way they recognized, intentionally or not, that the attraction of collectible fads was not the actual items collected, but the act of collecting them. Once you have a Beanie Baby, or issue #1 of a comic book, you’ve got it. That’s it. There’s nothing more to do than let it collect dust—or, more accurately, do everything in your power to <em>prevent</em> <em>it </em>from collecting dust, which might cause its condition to degrade, in anticipation of its future resale value. But with <em>Pokémon </em>and <em>Magic,</em> the thrill of the hunt never ends. There will always be another edition, another installment in the series, another deck to build, another gym leader to defeat. <em>Magic</em> offers tournaments. And with <em>Pokémon, </em>you can always reset the game and start fresh, all 151 of them (remember, we’re talking about <em>Red </em>here) once again ahead of you.</p>
<p>Its U.S. release came a few weeks after the start of my 8<sup>th</sup> grade school year, which made me just barely too old to be able to enjoy it unironically without serious social consequences in my middle-class, Columbus, Ohio setting. This didn’t stop me from putting a few dozen hours into it. Amidst the flood of collection fads, even kids couldn’t keep track of all of them, and I managed a play-through before most of the kids in my grade knew enough about what <em>Pokémon </em>was to make fun of it.</p>
<p>And it was, beyond a doubt, too real.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s what I learned about <em>Pokémon Red</em> from my one play-through: the hero’s default name is Ash, and unlike his anime counterpart, he has no voice, no friends, and no goals of his own.</p>
<p>He spends the game wandering through similar-looking fields, between similar-looking towns, performing the same tasks with gradually higher numbers attached. Things happen to him and around him, but he doesn’t exactly drive the plot in any way. No urgency or desire seems to compel him along his journey; he wants only what he is told to want by the NPCs he encounters.</p>
<p>He is subject to a one-sided rivalry with a kid named Gary, who will not leave Ash alone despite his complete lack of any expressed interest in said rivalry. Gary is so obsessed with one-upping Ash that he becomes the champion of the coveted Indigo League, purely for the purpose of challenging and defeating Ash when he arrives there. If Ash ever thinks twice about Gary, we never see it. For Ash, Gary is just another trainer to defeat.</p>
<p>The institutions he interacts with (Pokémon training, gym battles, Team Rocket) are of great importance to the game’s world, but <em>he</em> is not. He might as well be anybody else who is assigned to accomplish the prescribed goals of his host society. As a character, he is indistinguishable from the long succession of mostly nameless trainers he battles during the course of the game. Aside from the player’s ability to direct his actions by pressing buttons, he is basically an NPC himself. His quest to become “the very best, like no one ever was” (a phrase that only appears in the anime, with no equally grand sentiment appearing anywhere in the game) is not so much a Hero’s Journey as it is a Kafkaesque nightmare.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of Kafkaesque nightmares, here are a few facts about me as an 8<sup>th</sup> grader in the days before anyone had the gall to call 8<sup>th</sup> graders “Middle School seniors”:</p>
<p>After years of being on the receiving end of my school’s active bullying scene, I had gained some tentative acceptance among the popular crowd. Relatively safe from harm, I was still very much aware of the fact that I was an outsider in the group, less accepted <em>per se </em>than tolerated. I had learned to put on the right clothes and use the right slang, but it was more important that I never give them a reason to question whether I should really be there. I could never fight with anyone, because it would be too easy for everyone to side with the more established friend, and then all the work I had put into making myself safe would fall apart.</p>
<p>I spent a lot more time going to the woods by myself than I did hanging out with other kids my age, partly because I valued my alone time, but mostly it was a relief from the pressure of having to perform popular-ness. I did this so often, my Dad thought I must be secretly dating a girl, which was something I knew better than to do. Dating people usually involves eventually breaking up with them, and breaking up with someone usually involves fighting with them, and I could never fight anyone. I could have brought my Game Boy with me to the woods to play <em>Pokémon Red, </em>but I never did.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s another, more important fact about me in 8<sup>th</sup> grade: growing up in the ‘90s in a middle class household, with a dad who also happened to be first-generation Holocaust diaspora, presented me with a lot of mixed signals.</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I received a lot of participation trophies, which lived briefly on top of my dresser, and then in a box under my bed until I could secretly dispose of them without hurting anyone’s feelings. Middle-class 90s kids got a lot of encouragement. A lot of “if you work hard, you can achieve anything you set your heart on.” Be the very best, like no one ever was. Never mind that all of your classmates are being told the exact same thing; any of you might as well be any other one of you, in that sense.</p>
<p>But in my case, there was also a lot of pressure not to stand out <em>too much</em>, or in the wrong ways, because very bad things can happen to you when you do that. Previous generations in my family had gotten this message in the harshest way possible. The habits it made them prone to were and are hard to shake off, especially when acceptance of Jewish people and culture in America was and is short-standing and tentative. Much like my own social standing at the time.</p>
<p>The synthesis of all this was a constant mandate to grind out grades and personal achievements, working toward a nebulous idea of The American Dream whose specifics never quite solidified. Making honor roll was a worthy goal, but any kind of genuine personal fulfillment had to be kept off the radar. “If you work hard, you can achieve anything you set your heart on, as long as you don’t set your heart on anything in particular.” The very best, but the very best what, exactly? Unclear. The reason for wanting to get on honor roll could be nothing more than moving on to the next grade and working toward making honor roll there.</p>
<p>Similar fields, similar towns. Same tasks, gradually higher numbers attached. Wants only what they are told to want.</p>
<p>An NPC in my own game. My entire life, a collection fad with no purpose other than to endlessly continue collecting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s what I really mean when I say that <em>Pokémon Red</em> was too real for me: I understand the comfort afforded by an endless grind for which the only reward is more grind, perhaps a little too well. It’s about maintaining the appearance of working toward something, without the pressure of having to derive any ultimate fulfillment from whatever it is.</p>
<p>At some point I looked at Ash’s blank-faced, monochrome avatar and noticed that the biggest thing we shared, more than an interest in collecting <em>Pokémon </em>or being the very best, was the inability to express any real joy in the moments when we achieved what we were supposed to want.</p>
<p>I saw him standing in what looked much like any other patch of high-grass in the game and wondered if maybe he had just been wandering around that same field outside of Pallet Town the whole time. Thought about how he could do exactly that and, at a glance, it would look like he was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing. Realized that we were both caught in a cycle, always fixated on preparing to move on to the next phase of our lives, which leads to nothing except an eventual preparation for death.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>Pokémon Red</em>, Ash defeats the Elite Four and his self-proclaimed rival and becomes the new champion, and the result of this is <em>nothing</em>. The result is that you either reset the game or wait for the next installment of the series to come out so that you can do it all again, from the beginning. Even in the end, the only reward is repetition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Colette Arrand is a transsexual poet from Detroit, Michigan. She is the author of </em>Hold Me Gorilla Monsoon<em> and </em>To Denounce the Evils of Truth<em>. She is currently a student at the University of Georgia and is the founding editor of </em>The Wanderer<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Two of Colette Arrand&#8217;s Pokédex-inspired pieces appeared in the first year of  </em>Cartridge Lit<em>. Below, she discusses these works, as well as wrestling and more, with editor A.A. Balaskovits.</em></p>
<p><strong>We published </strong><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/12/01/rattata-cubone/" target="_blank">“<strong>Rattata</strong>”<strong> and </strong>“<strong>Cubone,</strong>”</a><strong> two parts of your longer project to write (or re-write) all 151 Pokémon from the first generation game. <a href="http://themondegreen.org/rodgers-three-lyric-essays/" target="_blank">These</a> <a href="https://theoffingmag.com/micro/004-charmander-by-colette-arrand/" target="_blank">pieces</a> are so <a href="http://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2016/06/004-charmander/" target="_blank">wonderfully</a> <a href="http://hardlydoughnuts.com/colette-arrand" target="_blank">startling</a> because, while it’s cheap to say you <a href="http://thecollagist.com/the-collagist/2015/11/7/011-metapod.html" target="_blank">elevate</a> pop culture, you explore the depth of these <a href="http://thecollagist.com/the-collagist/2015/11/7/129-magikarp.html" target="_blank">monsters</a>, as well as yourself, in each re-telling. How did this project come to be? </strong></p>
<p>I started writing the Pokémon essays, I think, on a dare. When I used to drink, a party trick of mine would be to talk to people about how things they remembered as innocent were either gayer or sadder than they realized. Like how action movie villains are motivated by a desire for the hero&#8217;s body, for example. Pokémon was a big part of my childhood—the original games were released on my birthday, the cartoon was an obsession. I think that’s a shared experience for a lot of people my age. But beneath the surface of a fun RPG or goofy anime there was something considerably darker. We, as players, were instructed to go out into the world and collect data on monsters, that data often including a horrific backstory. Mad science, dying worlds, unforeseen transformations, death—all of these things have been part of Pokémon from the start, and the way those things exist in that universe, observed as an adult, triggered certain processes where I’d remember a mood or feeling that I’d never quite dealt with before, but could do in the form of something that was vaguely poetic. Rattata and Cubone were the first two that I wrote—I hastily submitted them to Cartridge Lit as fiction and then changed my mind because there was something in the operating metaphors of those paragraphs that was too true to be labeled as such. And the project got rolling from there.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of your Pokémon essays are biographical, which heightens tension of the reader (outsider) looking into the life of the writer (player). Pokémon was a part of your childhood, but why use it for the lens of what is, perhaps, telling your own story now as an adult? </strong></p>
<p>A few things—first, I’m fascinated by Pokémon as a game that is a series of random encounters. The game sets a goal of catching every monster, but completing this task isn’t guaranteed, as to catch a monster you need to see it. That kind of random encounter is, in a way, how my memory functions. For whatever reason, it isn’t such a great or reliable tool—one of the essays, about Porygon, covers this—and, as such, I’m left with an encounter and its aftermath, a means of framing what is an admittedly incomplete picture. Second, Pokémon is a role-playing game, and what any good RPG asks us to do, whether or not we’re playing as an avatar upon whom ourselves are projected, is to transpose our persons onto the action of the game. Sometimes this is clumsy—western RPGs and their reliance on a basic meter of good versus bad reactions to story events—and sometimes it’s suggested. Without me, the main character in Pokémon is just a boy who has a hat and a mentor who can’t remember his own grandson’s name. With me, the story has a richness that is otherwise unaccounted for. That was true of how I played as a child and how I play games as an adult—my life is the lens through which I look at any object. If I pull that object out and use *it* as a lens, the object doesn’t change so much as the things I observe using that object as an aide do.</p>
<p><strong>You recently published your first poetry / comic book collection, <em><a href="http://www.abadpennyreview.com/store/hold-gorilla-monsoon-colette-arrand/" target="_blank">Hold Me Gorilla Monsoon</a></em>, with Opo Books and Objects. These poems focus on wrestling and how your identity and experiences have been shaped through this art form. This bit, from the first poem, really stuck out to me:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>…. wrestling fans</p>
<p>hold up the time Roland Barthes went</p>
<p>to the matches as proof that there’s a kind</p>
<p>of art at work grander than the illusion</p>
<p>of contact</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I picked up a lot of this repeated in this book: how much there is violence, and beauty, within interaction, physical and not.</strong></p>
<p>I think there’s two pretty common ways of looking at wrestling, at least in the poem you mention—one in which the world exists in the state of kayfabe (everything being real all the time), and one where the viewer knows what’s going on and watches despite or because of that knowledge. In both instances, people are trying to figure out what makes a wrestling match “work,” and, in both instances, the answer is the same: emotion. As a child, emotion was easy enough for wrestling to tease out from my consciousness. Good guys were wronged by bad guys, and I wanted to see justice. As you grow older, the narrative is complicated by who you are and what you believe—Hulk Hogan is usually the first person to cheat in a match, bad guys often have a point to make—so what do you do with that? Furthermore, you’ve got to deal with the fact that wrestlers exist as real and fictitious beings simultaneously. Ric Flair can be a millionaire playboy in wrestling, but his inability to play that character in real life leads him to the circumstances of his life now, where he has to sell off the things he bragged about for so long in order to live. In a way, that’s a kind of hyperreal version of my own life, where I’ve had to sell off things that I loved—record collections, video games, books—in order to eat. As a fan in the crowd, I’m meant to aspire to the man or womanhood of the people in the ring. As a human being, I can relate to those people as fellow human beings. Our pains and joys, regardless of how distinct they may feel because, say, Adrian Adonis is a fake gay man and I’m a person who used to scan as gay and now read far more confusingly, are relatable. The violence of those things can haunt or scar us, but just as often they can produce something beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>You’re uniquely able to tease out sharp edges in what are often considered </strong>“<strong>fluff</strong>”<strong> subjects, like video games and wrestling, and some might say that these sorts of things are not worthy of being </strong>“<strong>art,</strong>”<strong> since they’re so highly consumable. </strong></p>
<p>The thing about that is that they’re already art, and that things that have historically been counted as art are consumed much the same way as things like video games or wrestling. The amount of time and effort that goes into a public presentation like a video game is mind boggling, and we’re entering an era where that medium is taken as seriously as film or television are, two things that were, at one point in time, accused of “dumbing down” the populace in much the same way games are now and have been for a few decades. But people in fields like poetry or fiction don’t blink an eye at a book fashioned after an object like a film or a movie, and the perception that video games belong to a kind of degenerate trash culture is also changing—too many of us play and write about too many games for the medium to remain “fluff,” which it never was. I think where writers and critics like me come in is in our ability to evaluate a game not just on typical merits, like how well a game’s levels are designed or how responsive its controls are, but emphatically. What a game like Pokémon evokes in a player is just as important as the end goal of being the very best within the universe stored on your cartridge.</p>
<p><strong>What Pokémon essays are you working on now? </strong></p>
<p>Recently, I finished revising a second edition of <em>To Denounce the Evils of Truth</em>, a chapbook that came out last year and promptly disappeared due to difficulties the publisher was having. The full *book* is a long, somewhat agonizing process—I joked on Twitter once that I hoped enough traumatic stuff happened to me that I could finish the book, and life, of course, has provided. But in the meantime, it is nice to have something from the book available in something less scattered than a collection of weblinks and print journals, so I’ve added six essays to the original manuscript and have, in many instances, radically revised some of the pieces. The end result is that I’ve been able to think of the book more in terms of an overall finished piece rather than an essay written here or there, and I’m looking forward to seeing what comes out of that space next.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Pallet Town</strong></p>
<p>Consciousness does not always begin<br />
with waking, but a quiet disorientation<br />
of glinting metal, curtainless windows,<br />
books on the floor like upturned palms.</p>
<p>The street is set with houses basking<br />
in the company of cherry blossoms –<br />
not mean or rowdy, but calibrated<br />
pipettes of fuchsia and adoration.</p>
<p>It is the bed you have been resting in<br />
for years. Someone is making coffee<br />
and expecting you to rise. Your body<br />
measures the character of this silence</p>
<p>but there are languages outside<br />
of geometry. Your mouth is dry.<br />
It has started to rain and this town<br />
will not be how you remember it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Manual for Starter Pokemon</strong></p>
<p><em>I. Bulbasaur</em></p>
<p><span class="full">Of all ancient-footed soil-sifters</span><br />
<span class="half">you know these rituals best, first</span><br />
the crinkled promise of a seed,<br />
<span class="half">pact with the dark, then an embryo&#8217;s</span><br />
<span class="full">bloodless feast on damp and sun.</span><br />
<span class="half">When the shadow of your labours</span><br />
eclipses your own, fertile bulb<br />
<span class="half">cleaving open, you cannot ignore</span><br />
<span class="full">how the language of nature is</span><br />
<span class="half">an unnatural one: germination,</span><br />
photosynthesis, self-serving pollination.<br />
<span class="half">Nothing has changed. Your burden</span><br />
<span class="full">is no less because it has bloomed.</span></p>
<p><em>II. Charmander</em></p>
<p><span class="half">Never the flame, but restraint</span><br />
<span class="full">of its reptilian temper. Make peace</span><br />
<span class="half">where confrontation is poor excuse</span><br />
for glory. Winged or quick-clawed,<br />
<span class="half">the battles which matter are the ones</span><br />
<span class="full">bargained with yourself, pride of identity,</span><br />
<span class="half">unattainable flight. Yet what little room</span><br />
for compromise in this <em>Bildungsroman</em><br />
<span class="half">is down to luck. Incinerate your bets.</span><br />
<span class="full">Nothing comes from playing with fire.</span></p>
<p><em>III. Squirtle</em></p>
<p>Like all rivers, the one buried in you<br />
<span class="half">has neither head nor tail, but endless</span><br />
<span class="full">regard for past and future allegiances.</span><br />
<span class="half">Take heed of its density, how a friend</span><br />
resists or embraces water. Shell, carved from<br />
<span class="half">calloused skin and bruises, is not armour</span><br />
<span class="full">but to accept vulnerability. The same</span><br />
<span class="half">is true of friendship: next to each other</span><br />
but oceans apart.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyrus is a boy with a friend named Totoro. Totoro is an animal who follows Cyrus around like a puppy, but is most assuredly not a puppy. Totoro is blue and has a tail like a dinosaur and is round and hairless and unbearably cute, as animated sprites often are. Totoro has big eyes and tiny fat fingers and sometimes Totoro squirts water from its mouth powerfully enough to knock out the dozens or hundreds of other little monsters it fights. They’re all cute too: cute bees and cute spiders (!) and adorable eagles and chickens, everything with big eyes and smiley faces. Everything is so cute it needs to be hugged and squeezed.</p>
<p>Cyrus and Totoro are best buddies. I’m not sure why, but they are. And their world is bright and colorful. The trees are all uniformly green and their tops are round. Humans walk around with cheery smiles. I want to like this world because Cyrus and Totoro are clearly having the best time ever, and since I’m playing as Cyrus and I chose Totoro, I should be having the best time as well. I should be having the best time ever catching them all.</p>
<p>There’s a problem, however. I will never catch them all. I will never find out how many there are because, ten hours in, I&#8217;m never going to play <em>Pokémon</em> again.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I was in my late teens, my then-girlfriend Michelle waxed poetic about the band Tool. “They’re so good,” she said. She had long black hair and anime eyes. “You should really listen.”</p>
<p>As I was half in love, half in lust with her, I gave Tool a hard listen. For those unfamiliar with late-90s, early-00s rock music, Tool was popular for melding the sludgy sounds of 80s industrial with the screechy guitars of metal while retaining a kind of pop sensibility. They also made creepy videos of melting puppets on conveyor belts.</p>
<p>I tried to like Tool. I wanted to please Michelle and, besides, cool people liked Tool. I tried so hard to like “Numb” and “Sober,” and every album Michelle gave me. But try as I might, I hated Tool. I hated their angsty lyrics and their half-tuned guitar sound. I loathed their creepy, pretentious videos and CD inserts of mud-colored tragedy. Most of all, I hated Maynard Keenan’s voice. It was screechy and pompous and reminded me of sweat and the misery of playing right field in Little League and not understanding geometry and everything else I’ve ever hated.</p>
<p>That was the first time I allowed myself to hate a piece of pop culture that was “objectively” good and critically adored, if I believed in an objective universe (which I might not). Later pieces of the gestalt that have found their way into my “I don’t care if other people love it, I still think it sucks” pile includes <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Soundgarden, everything by Elton John (except Tiny Dancer), Bridesmaids, <em>Jane Eyre</em> and Gwen Stefani.</p>
<p>When I told Michelle I didn’t like it, she rolled her eyes and said, “Fine. Let’s go smoke,” and that was the end of the conversation. <em>That’s it?</em> It was freeing, to know my taste on something had no impact on the world.</p>
<p>This is a roundabout way of saying that <em>Pokémon</em> is the biggest time waste I’ve encountered in a long time. And that’s just fine with me.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <em>Pokémon</em> series of games is about capturing monsters. That, to the best of my knowledge, is the entirety of it. Oh, there are puzzles and the battle system is dope. I love the cycling of your team based on strengths, weaknesses, and experience needs, but that’s all incidental dressing. The story, the tutorials—everything is about capturing monsters.  </p>
<p>In my brief journey with <em>Pokémon SoulSilver</em>, I encountered three or four dozen of adorable little sprites: bugs, worms, turtles, badgers, beetles, eagles, mushrooms, vampire bats, even a “bulbasaur.” There are hundreds, if not thousands, more. It’s right there in the tagline: “Gotta’ catch em all!” In all fairness, developers and marketers are hiding nothing.</p>
<hr />
<p>In ’02, I was home from school on break and hanging out in my brother’s basement apartment with my buddy Brian. We were probably drinking, probably sneaking out the basement door to smoke.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?” he asked. I had not thought much about it and said so.</p>
<p>“Want to watch <em>Pokémon</em>?”</p>
<p>“I thought it was a card game,” I responded. I’d heard of the card of course, though I had never picked it up. When <em>Pokémon</em> came out I was deeply immersed in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and had no room for another nerdy, time-consuming game. I eventually stopped playing <em>Magic</em> when I was in college, and I had no time or desire to replace it.</p>
<p>“It’s a TV show, too,” Brian said. “And now, a movie. And we should watch it.”</p>
<p>And watch it we did. <em>Pokémon: The First Movie</em> was a jaunty, oddly morose cartoon feature film. There was a bipedal-ish Pokémon named Mewtwo who was, I think, the anti-Christ, metaphorically speaking. And there was a kid with a red cap; a team of villains who were drawn with high cheekbones and revealing clothing; and there was a dark-skinned fella who looked perma-stoned. The movie was cheery and kind of funny and I had no problem watching it. Afterwards, I felt Brian’s stare.</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well what did you think?” He smiled and scratched the skin beneath his wispy beard.</p>
<p>“It was cute,” I said.</p>
<p>“No. What did you <em>think</em>? About <em>Pokémon</em>?”</p>
<p>This time I realized he wasn’t asking me what I thought of the movie. He wasn’t asking a question at all. He was doing the same thing I did every time I made someone watch an episode of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>. What he was really saying was, “Validate me<em>.”</em></p>
<p>And I was at a loss. I said, “Let’s watch <em>Breakfast Club</em>.” And we never discussed it again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fast-forward to 2015. Now that I’m back on the video game train, I ask Brian to loan me a <em>Pokémon</em> for the Nintendo Developer’s System (DS). He gives me options: new versions or old. I bring <em>Pokémon SoulSilver</em> home. According to cursory Wikipedia research that—deliberately not updated—it had initially been two separate games for the Gameboy and merged and updated for the DS release. This may not be a strictly accurate, but it’s good enough.</p>
<p>I know there’s a problem shortly after I turn it on and pick a water Pokémon because cuteness. <em>Pokémon</em> has cuteness in spades. I love the animation, the bright colors, the retro-futuristic homes and towns, the ridiculously cuddly-looking animals. It’s a world without identifiable illness or old age or homelessness. It’s the idyll of <em>Earthbound </em>without the deep cynicism and pain. I name my Croconaw Totoro and happily wander off to experience a story.</p>
<p>For over a week, whenever I’m on the light rail or right before bed and other downtime, I wander the map on my handheld screen, solving rudimentary puzzles and capturing well over a dozen little buddies: Vlad (a bat), Chicky (some egg-shaped creature), Murder (a rat), and Pudge (a chicken). I beat two gyms and smack around dozens of little pissants that try to step to my avatar. Little Totoro is level 20 and most of my main team is leveled to mid-teens.</p>
<p>But by the time I clear the second town, Azalea, the difficulty curve has spiked and I realize that I need to get my guys competitive. It will take a little grinding, but afterwards I’ll be ready for the next town and the next showdown with my nemesis, Teo. He almost beat me with his little grass monster and a couple nobodies leveled to 18. Those few levels were the whole reason for challenge. Time to grind. An hour passes before I’m satisfied.</p>
<p>When I succeeded in leveling all my buddies, it occurred to me that I was only ten hours into the game and had spent over 10 percent of that time grinding. I’m not opposed to grinding in theory; I spent dozens of hours doing the same in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> to beat Ruby Weapon. I’d spent even more hours beating the main boss in <em>Paladin’s Quest</em> on the SNES. When I was in my teens, I must have spent a hundred hours wandering the dinosaur forest leveling mindlessly until I wondered why I was doing it. If there was a reason, and if I was using my time effectively.</p>
<p>After that first hour of grinding in Pokémon, I had a revelation: <em>Why? </em><em>Why was my nemesis my nemesis? Why was I even wandering around? And who was I, anyway? What exactly do I need more Pokémon for? I like my 6-monster team. But maybe they’re not that good. Should I swap more out? How am I supposed to know? And do I need to level them all?</em></p>
<p>Those is daunting, existential shit. I have enough of that in my life. I don’t need it in my games. And on a pure mechanics level, my guys take several hundred exp to raise levels. Wild Pokémon give 30 experience points. That’s a lot of grinding. And again, why am I even doing it? <em>Am I enjoying myself?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>There’s, like, ten million versions of <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s sold millions of copies. There are half-a-dozen movies about it, and a television show. The gear is everywhere. I played for ten hours because there had to be something there, some quality. Sometimes three billion smokers are right. Sometimes, Nirvana is #1 on the <em>Billboard</em> charts and everything is peaceful and right in the world. Sometimes Tool fans know what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, <em>Pokémon</em> <strong>is</strong> awesome. It’s perfectly designed. The ultra-obsessed collectible-hunter will never put this down. Pokémon hide in grass, under boulders, in trees, in houses—everywhere. You just have to check everything if you want ‘em all.</p>
<p>And the game is deep, complex. There are hundreds of abilities, monsters in the triple-digits, an online <em>something </em>which I couldn’t bring myself to explore, items out the wazoo, scads of secrets and hidden areas. The combinations that you can put together seem limitless. It’s a perfect game in a lot of respects. And it’s brilliant in an insidiously Pavlovian way.</p>
<p>But here’s the other thing. It might be perfect, but it’s not for me. Why? It’s the same reason why I’ll always maintain that the Rolling Stones are unlistenable. They offer the kind of fun I don’t want. Culture is about taste and to me, <em>Pokémon</em> tastes like the underside of a shoe. A designer shoe, yeah, but it still tastes like shit.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the late &#8217;90s, I adopted a feral kitten, an orange ball of fur I named G-Money. And for a short time, everything was bliss. But because life isn’t fair, our little kitten died six months later. I buried him in the backyard by myself. Later, I poured beer on his grave because he would have wanted it that way.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I played <em>Monster Rancher 2</em> on the PSOne, because I thought it <strong>was</strong> <em>Pokémon</em>. And that game is no less a grind, but it’s different. You raise your little creature from birth. You train them and give them treats and yes, make them fight other monsters. Sometimes they get injured, and they all die eventually. When I beat that game, it was joyous, and then a month later my little G-Money died.</p>
<p>When my <em>Monster Rancher</em> pet died, I felt a little twinge that reminded me of my cat. In <em>Pokémon</em>, I felt nothing for little Totoro. It wasn’t the same. That’s not Totoro’s fault, or <em>Pokémon</em>’s, but it’s indicative of a missing connection, a missing heart. That the game was good—great even—was entirely beside the point. It offered something I didn’t want and lacked something I needed.</p>
<p>Quality guarantees nothing.</p>
<p>I don’t care that the Rolling Stones are arguably the GOAT. I don’t care that Tool is critically acclaimed. I can acknowledge the craft and still be uninterested. <em>Pokémon</em> is great for people named Not-Me. And I’m fine with it. I am liberated from caring.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the world of <em>Pokémon SoulSilver</em>, I played as a boy named Cyrus and got a best friend Pokémon because of a reason I couldn’t decipher. And there’s a boy named Teo who stole another Pokémon because evil? I’m not sure. A good story might have coaxed a couple more dozen hours from me, especially if I could have power-gamed to get to the end. But I had no incentive to continue besides catching them all. What would I do once I caught them? I collect lots of dumb things I don’t need; I don’t need my lunchbox collection and I certainly don’t need my vintage <em>Star Wars</em> collection. But I could sell them or set up Luke and Leia in compromising positions and giggle. What can I do with a hundred pieces of data in a game I’m bored by?</p>
<p>Shut them all off, I suppose.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>19. Rattata</strong></em></p>
<p>I was glad for a friend who loved garbage as I did. Who was born from it and for it. Who loved my books because of their cheapness, because the titles were lewd though not meant to be but whose covers were because breasts and filth remain popular, even if in secret. I read them and you ate them, sinking your teeth into each pulpy morsel. Your mouth was foaming and I was concerned. You said to shut up and let it foam. You made it clear that we were not friends.</p>
<p>Today I woke to find you gone and have no name to call out into the wild. I tried giving you a name once, but you rejected it. You said that your proper name rolled easily enough from tongues used to fashioning weapons from words. You thought so little of my tongue. I search the gutters and the brush wordlessly. The tall grasses and dark corners of basements. Landfills, abandoned houses, traps left out to poison and kill you. At night, when bright eyes shine out from the pores of the earth, I pray that two are yours. Stay the night, please. If you must, chew on me.</p>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>104. Cubone</strong></em></p>
<p>“Wears the skull of its deceased mother. Its cries echo inside the skull and come out as a sad melody.” &#8211; Pokémon Yellow</p>
<p>Each of us wears our mother—her presence or her absence—but you have chosen to wear her skull. I want to tell you how fucked up this is, but that would be rude. We drink, then I ask how you came by the skull of your mother. You say nothing because I know how it happened, I’ve asked before, and you don’t want to repeat that story, not really. But here is how you came to wear your mother’s skull:</p>
<p>First, your mother died. You did not see her die as you were busy clawing your way out of the egg, but as you are wearing her skull we can be sure she is dead. The rest you saw, having broken free, having wiped the amniotic fluid from your eyes. You were already learning how to walk. You were walking towards your mother. But she wasn’t breathing, and your father, wearing his mother’s skull, was wailing, and this was the first thing you heard. Sure, there was the wind. Sure, in the distance, innumerable animals shrieked, but your father’s pain was local. Immediate. Then your father removed your mother’s helmet—her mother’s skull. It was the only time you saw her face. Was she beautiful? Hideous? This you’ve never shared. Your father skinned your mother and cleaned her skull. He placed it upon your head. It didn’t fit at first, but you grew into it.</p>
<p>When your father died, there was no story to be told; he just died. You did not claim his bones. You didn’t even cry. Why would you? Your father was good to you, but he was also your father. I want to say how fucked up that is, but I still have a father and a mother. You are crying now. You will cry all night. Your cries are beautiful, notes from a dream instrument playing in the heart of a deep cavern. Your cries are your mother’s cries. They fill the room, but they don’t bring her back.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not even your goddamned grandfather can remember<br />
your name. I hate it</p>
<p>that we both own that specific brand of suffering, fucked-up<br />
families—I mean what kind of broken</p>
<p>mother sends her child wilderness-bound with a backpack<br />
a pet, and a pat on the ass? God, mom,</p>
<p>I’m <em>eleven</em>. What I know about battles is keeping<br />
a berry tree alive past its first sprout.</p>
<p>What I know of patience is walking the long way<br />
around the tall grasses. My only risks, ledges.</p>
<p>All I’ve ever known of desire is possession. When he asks me<br />
to name my enemy, it’s always after</p>
<p>someone I used to love. What’s the difference?<br />
Something small and painful, I’m sure, unimportant</p>
<p>when it all comes down to it—a splinter, a pebble in my shoe.<br />
<em>Choose</em>! I always make these decisions for you.</p>
<p>Destiny sits round in my palm. Yours is whatever foils me—lick of fire<br />
to my tranquil green, sea lapped against</p>
<p>my single spark. I<em> want to be the very best—</em>and the best is only<br />
better than you. My whole</p>
<p>life alongside yours, your steps the trail to every town, your shadow<br />
the dark of every cave.</p>
<p>I know, in the end, it comes down to this—you and I together.<br />
On the road to victory, your body</p>
<p>locked there, looking out. In the final battle,<br />
your name tumbling from my mouth.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>when you’re offered a choice, it’s easy to be entranced by alternatives. unlimited agency! and even tho you’re picking one path of three, you end up on the same road, starting in the colour of nowhere and ending maybe one day in your name among ephemera and dead batteries. what starts as one decision ends up as a thousand—the mechanism of every second pulling you in uncountable directions. the progress of spinning in place, the trek through the same footprints you’ve worn into memory—and then you open your eyes &amp; nothing is the same. the world vanishes by white out, in an instant, leaves you a pocketful less certain of your purpose, and the memory of heat and light vanished in bad decisions you don’t remember making; all because you wanted to decide. all along a route you lose in lightning, messianics and the treachery of swirls and circles pulling your mind in two separate directions until every direction is so twisted that the star is a saviour and the ocean is singing and you remember something very bad about burning that you never want to remember again—and sometimes it stops. and one time, it stops. and you open your eyes. and you see how a single second stretched out to lead you here—and seconds matter. and so do you.</p>
