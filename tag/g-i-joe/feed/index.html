				<description><![CDATA[<p>When they made a toy of you<br />
Did you dream of children<br />
Thinking you’re the good guy</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What did you want to be<br />
When you were little<br />
Was your mother a black pyramid<br />
Some ancient burial ground<br />
Now furnished with computers<br />
Your father was fear, but also industry<br />
Shouting from your lair’s mezzanine<br />
Like any good father<br />
Clean your room, mow the lawn<br />
You keep masks, one blue<br />
The other silver, just like father</p>
<p>What’s it like having a son<br />
Who wants to kill you<br />
They say the blue is to hide<br />
Your scarred face<br />
But it’s really for sadness isn’t it<br />
Another blue day<br />
Followed by another blue day</p>
<p>What did you do<br />
When they made a toy of you<br />
Did you dream of children<br />
Thinking you’re the good guy</p>
<p>To me, your home was an arcade cab<br />
In a laundromat in Oregon</p>
<p>Is it hard to be a hero<br />
When you’ve never won a battle<br />
You lost every Saturday<br />
In a ritual of death<br />
We have that in common<br />
You and I</p>
