								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are absolutely thrilled to announce that Georgia Bellas&#8217; poem, &#8220;<a target="_blank" title="How Not to Win at Big Buck Hunter" href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/06/23/win-big-buck-hunter/">How Not to Win At Big Buck Hunter</a>,&#8221; has been selected for the <em>Best of the Net 2014</em> anthology, published by Sundress Publications. We&#8217;re thrilled that Georgia&#8217;s poem will soon be showcased to a much larger audience—anyone who knows Georgia, in person or via Twitter, knows that she is incredibly deserving.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Kathy Fagan for selecting the piece, to Nick McRae for coordinating the selection process, and to the rest of the team at Sundress Publications.</p>
<p>On a selfish note, we&#8217;re incredibly excited to bring out brand of video game-inspired literature to a wider audience. We hope it continues and strengthens the conversation we&#8217;re trying to start here. And to have a piece selected within our first year of publication—well, that&#8217;s a testament to <em>all</em> our incredibly talented contributors.</p>
<p>Give Georgia your congratulations on Twitter: <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/MrBearStumpy">@MrBearStumpy</a>!</p>
