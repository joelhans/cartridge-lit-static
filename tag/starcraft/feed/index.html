								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Skull Kid’s Lament for the Dead</strong></p>
<p>Great world sinker they called<br />
as you shaved your eyebrows</p>
<p>&amp; gifted me the three jewels.<br />
The dog headed. The horse headed.</p>
<p>The owl headed. The world tree<br />
spat out three nuts. These nuts</p>
<p>grew into you, me, &amp;<br />
another tree. The upstart</p>
<p>tree truly believed in love.<br />
It truly wished to see adults</p>
<p>die. I led people into the forest<br />
&amp; they died. I truly hate adults.</p>
<p>The Gorons have allied<br />
with the King of Hyrule.</p>
<p>But the command is swallow, every<br />
time. The Hylians do not eat rock!</p>
<p>The Hylians do not eat rock!<br />
Your eyebrows are waterfowl,</p>
<p>your tunic my resting place.<br />
Tie me to your shoe; I would sink with you.</p>
<p>You are strong enough to find the worm.<br />
You are strong enough to eat my stew.</p>
<p>How boring the people of all nations<br />
come together. Either imperialism or</p>
<p>communism. I don&#8217;t care for the end<br />
of this game. Every struggle is the struggle</p>
<p>for the maintenance of heterosexuality.<br />
Can it be otherwise while the jewels</p>
<p>spill from your nose &amp; into my loving chute.<br />
Can we mages dream? i.e. a ghost</p>
<p>chitters in the field &amp; you kill it<br />
&amp; its lantern falls &amp; starts no small fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Runescape</strong></p>
<p>What dragon is between us?<br />
Drop party. You in teal armor.<br />
You in bark armor. Archer kills me</p>
<p>in forest and I lose your<br />
ring. I mine coal and you<br />
give me a ring and we marry.</p>
<p>First sexual encounter.<br />
Private chat this purpled text.<br />
Bury my giant bones. Your prayer</p>
<p>level and fishing and cut right<br />
across the desert. We are just<br />
underneath the beginners. When</p>
<p>fields are cast with slaughtered<br />
goblins? The year Sk8r Boi<br />
came out we killed</p>
<p>a vampire together. What we found<br />
in his basement. Switches on<br />
off. Daily you take me to runes</p>
<p>and god words and black-armored<br />
knights. I mine silver and you cook<br />
a pie in the public house. My red bar.</p>
<p>Loading screen takes for ever.<br />
These hunters keep arrowing the wilds.<br />
Squeeze through. Take me. On. Sugar</p>
<p>battle axe lag. My DPS into<br />
you. If you arrow me here I will<br />
leave behind all but three items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Tides of an Un-Winnable War Are Upon Us</strong></p>
<p>%uh<br />
Don’t care who<br />
Country <span style="margin-left: 110px;">the weak</span><br />
Recent events to be sure<br />
Call to resign<br />
No <span style="margin-left: 35px;">human did not</span><br />
parents just about done<br />
While you’re at it<br />
Fetish our common history<br />
Time greater conflict has two<br />
Against us threatening to destroy<br />
All have accomplished<br />
Many Nations Individual<br />
Now hawks act tired<br />
Open on <span style="margin-left: 50px;">the winnable are upon us</span><br />
Refuge on higher ground<br />
Lest we be swept away to receive<br />
Whatever protection once provided<br />
Man memory<br />
With our enemies left unchecked<br />
You turned <span style="margin-left: 100px;">action cash</span><br />
Rock we have <span style="margin-left: 82px;">storming gowns</span><br />
Now mine said go on manage no me<br />
Hard time just a row in June<br />
Humana denies spring already<br />
How many times to decide actions<br />
Carolina’s come show<br />
Morning <span style="margin-left: 46px;">we three shall watch over you</span><br />
From this day forward that no human make war upon any other human<br />
Let me know tear <span style="margin-left: 46px;">and conspire</span><br />
Against this new beginning<br />
Let no man consort with the evening hours<br />
At all <span style="margin-left: 13px;">the enemies</span> <span style="margin-left: 32px;">of humanity</span><br />
Seek not<br />
Far away ball <span style="margin-left: 19px;">we show</span> winds <span style="margin-left: 100px;">through</span><br />
No matter <span style="margin-left: 100px;">no cost</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>When Your Madden Running Back Retires</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You curse him,<br />
shrug, note</p>
<p>his speed dropping<br />
two points a season</p>
<p>for the last<br />
three seasons,</p>
<p>relive the fumble<br />
in the January snow,</p>
<p>relive the shoulder injury<br />
that kept you from going</p>
<p>undefeated. You never needed<br />
him. But you wanted</p>
<p>one more 1,000 yard year,<br />
one more run</p>
<p>with the gem<br />
you discovered in the muck</p>
<p>of a fifth round video game draft.<br />
You want him to last</p>
<p>a little longer because<br />
if his knees have finally gone,</p>
<p>you have to think about your knees<br />
and the songs they sing</p>
<p>when you trade one can for another<br />
in the kitchen. He’s gone</p>
<p>away to spend more time with his family.<br />
When was the last time you called your family?</p>
<p>You do remember that it was family<br />
that put the controller in your hand</p>
<p>in the first place, don’t you?<br />
The envy only second sons can know</p>
<p>pushed you to push buttons faster,<br />
to push “mute” so mom didn’t find</p>
<p>your hands pawing a wet<br />
controller in the dead of the night.</p>
<p>Your brother stopped beating you<br />
years ago. Your mom’s just happy</p>
<p>you’re not dead and you’re not asking<br />
for money that much these days.</p>
<p>Your running back moved on.<br />
Your video game grew up.</p>
<p>What happened to you? Really,<br />
I’m asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>June 10, 1992</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent the hours punishing my brother<br />
with midair backbreakers and eating cheeseburgers.<br />
If I say it was the best day of my life,<br />
some of you will understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do They Play Like Ryu or Guile?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When life was as simple as a button<br />
combination and a sticky cabinet,</p>
<p>this question told us all we needed to know.<br />
It was “Ford or Chevy?” It was</p>
<p>“Batman or Superman?”<br />
Does this character move</p>
<p>in arcs and circles, nothing but<br />
tornadoes, cyclones,</p>
<p>and fireballs? Or are we charging<br />
in a straight line like Hector</p>
<p>and his phalanxes? Back-Forward.<br />
Up-Down. Remember</p>
<p>when these were the only options<br />
the world gave us. Remember</p>
<p>when they felt like all the choices<br />
we’d ever need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wings of Liberty</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We opened beers with our teeth<br />
because we were men, and men didn’t carry<br />
bottle openers on Spring Break.<br />
At the pier, we decided on oral sex</p>
<p>being a reciprocal thing because, well,<br />
manhood was about obligations.<br />
We spent days collecting names<br />
and numbers and faces, but at night</p>
<p>they never matched. We laid our IDs<br />
on the counters with pride and tried not to<br />
giggle into our rum because men<br />
didn’t giggle. We were old enough</p>
<p>to know that, old enough to drink and hold<br />
a dollar between a woman’s breasts<br />
in a strip club we could never find again.<br />
But men were explorers, and we found</p>
<p>our muse when she fell off the stage<br />
during “Air Force Ones.” She laughed;<br />
we laughed, but I wasn’t sure<br />
who was laughing at who</p>
<p>but I didn’t ask because men<br />
weren’t supposed to ask<br />
too many questions<br />
in front of a naked woman.</p>
<p>She whispered promises in my ear,<br />
but before I reached for my wallet<br />
the Terran theme from <em>Starcraft</em><br />
reached my ears. I waited to see</p>
<p>if my RTS-loving stripper fantasy<br />
was going to come true, but<br />
it didn’t. The music wasn’t for the stage.<br />
It was the DJ playing</p>
<p>the game in the back corner.<br />
I left my muse to go talk to a guy<br />
about siege tank defense and fucking<br />
Zerg rushes. He said he was just passing</p>
<p>the time, and we traded strategies<br />
while we watched space marines<br />
put flamethrowers to alien parasites<br />
instead of watching live</p>
<p>nude girls. The DJ joked about watching<br />
the wrong thing. I told him naked girls<br />
weren’t new to me. I lied. But I was honest<br />
about the Zerg. Without tanks, they were tough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>After I Heard Another White Woman at the Bar Talking About Michael Vick and the Death Penalty</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike, I wanted to hit her<br />
with a history lesson<br />
about black men</p>
<p>never getting what they deserve<br />
from the law.<br />
But she’ll go to OJ,</p>
<p>I’ll go to Emmett Till,<br />
She’ll say I can’t think<br />
of what it’s like to lose</p>
<p>a pet and I’ll say<br />
she can’t understand because she doesn’t<br />
have a black dick between her legs</p>
<p>and America around her neck<br />
and she’ll say it’s not the same<br />
and that’s the only thing we’ll agree on</p>
<p>before her boyfriend shows up<br />
with a shot and a shrug for everyone.<br />
Thing is, Mike, I wanted to hit you, too,</p>
<p>years before the first shovel<br />
touched your backyard<br />
in Virginia. But it wasn’t because of the rape</p>
<p>stands and electrocutions; it was because you ran<br />
circles around my linebackers on <em>Madden 2004</em>.<br />
You took away my safety</p>
<p>blitzes and zone coverages.<br />
If you finished the game, I was finished,<br />
so I hit you every play.</p>
<p>I hit you on run plays.<br />
I hit you on pass plays.<br />
I grinned every time</p>
<p>your virtual body broke<br />
and my opponents turned into Priam<br />
weeping over Hector’s corpse</p>
<p>or some other Trojan father whose son caught<br />
a spear with his throat.<br />
They didn’t want to go on without you</p>
<p>as their leader. The contest wasn’t worth<br />
the dollars on the coffee table<br />
if you weren’t standing.</p>
<p>They would swear they learned<br />
to never gamble their future<br />
on the shoulders of one man again.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the world care<br />
about a black body so much,<br />
even if I wanted to break it.</p>
