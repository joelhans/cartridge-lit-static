]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year and a half, since writing <em>Retrogamer</em>, I’ve played quite a few games, many because I legitimately wanted to play, or because they were highly recommended, but also because I thought people wanted to read about it. And I gave them a fair try, but I couldn’t get into them, not enough to write a long piece about how much I hated them. I could barely muster the energy to finish an hour or two of these games, with one notable exception.</p>
<p>But, welcome to speed dating for video games.</p>
<h2><strong>I.</strong><em><strong> Halo 2</strong></em><strong> (Xbox)</strong></h2>
<p>I liked <em>Contra</em> and I liked <em>Goldeneye</em>. I even liked the original <em>Halo</em> when it first came out, despite minimal playing time (I was in college). I liked <em>Fortress</em> and all those early PvP games played on college servers. I fully expected to like <em>Halo 2</em>, especially now that I was giving myself time to really dig into it. But, I realized very quickly that I have better things to do than map out attack patterns for exploitation and the exact steps to run a gauntlet while following directions from some dippy AI named Cortana.</p>
<p>The crux of this is that I’m missing something with first-person shooters. I know I am. And Halo, for all the trappings of science fiction joy, is still an FPS at its core. And that core is not what I dig. It’s dying and resetting and figuring out exactly where the enemies are located. It’s repetition and brute memorization. That’s not a game; that’s like learning multiplication tables.</p>
<p><em>Halo 2</em> reminded me of Cecily, the sweet Filipino-American woman I went on a single date with. She was tall and lithe and had delightfully dirty stories; she had a good job and a lovely kid that she showed me a picture of. She also had a dagger-field of topics I couldn’t discuss (politics, music, books, her family, sports, the Philippines) and jokes I couldn’t make, because she liked being the funny person in the room. I probably could have figured out the pattern, but, like <em>Halo 2</em>, I simply couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<h2>II. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, I lived with Jason, a recovering heroin addict. He spent a lot of time on the couch, playing GameCube and often, when leaving or coming home, I’d hang out with him and chain smoke cigarettes. While I’d sometimes play <em>Mario Party</em> with him, mostly I watched him play <em>Metroid Prime</em> and <em>Phantasy Star</em>. I liked him.</p>
<p>He died a few years later of a heroin overdose. I found out later, through friends of friends, because I had moved out of the house as soon as I put all the pieces together. Why our money was disappearing, why his friends were using our bathroom for an hour at a time, why a cop showed up at our early in the morning for no particular reason. This isn’t strictly related, but it feels that way. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> played like I imagined a heroin overdose would feel: slow, stultifying, mind-numbing, a product of poor decisions.</p>
<p>Phantasy Star 0 was half a hundred things warning signs, like platforming and weapon farming and minimal storyline. Warning signs I followed.</p>
<h2>III. <em>Final Fantasy III</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>Another victim of the blocky isometric necessity of the early aughts. What was the fixation with that crap? The load times that were put into the game in order to have these square-headed, lopsided monstrosities. Call me old-fashioned, call me a luddite, but I like my old-school RPGs, well, old school: pixels, cartridge-based, non-existent load times.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that <em>Final Fantasy III</em> is unplayable. I’ll track down a different re-mastered version and play that, one without 45-second load times between every single battle and dungeon. Especially on a portable platform, one that’s meant to be quick and easy.</p>
<h2>IV. <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>(PS3)</h2>
<p>Why didn’t I like <em>Mass Effect 2</em>? Why did I play it for three or four hours, put the controller down and simply never come back to it? I enjoyed the intro and the interface. I was engaged. It even felt like my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Sarah was a doctoral candidate in psychology, she liked <em>Dance, Dance, Dance</em> and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>. She had an adorable cat and a 1950s time capsule for an apartment. All stuff I dig.</p>
<p>After our second date, after we kissed in her doorway, I went away for a week. And then she had a conference. And then with one thing another, three months passed before we spoke again. By that time, she’d started dating her old friends-with-benefits and now they’re married. I&#8217;m happy for them.</p>
<p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was, on the surface, everything I looked for in a video game. But sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes people and places and games slip away, one moment at a time, until, with a look around, there’s a realization that time has moved on and if there was a space, that space has been filled.</p>
<h2>V. <em>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</em> (PS2)</h2>
<p>This was disappointing. <em>Fallout 3</em> was what re-ignited my love of video games in the first place. I knew it was based on the <em>Morrowind </em>engine and modeled around the same open world, quest-based fulcrum that enthralled me. And I love high fantasy, so this was obviously a win-win. But it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Turns out I no longer love high fantasy—not without irony or deviation from norms. I didn’t even make it out of the first town. The spark that drove me in <em>Fallout</em>—the gallows humor and meta-reference—was missing in <em>Morrowind</em>. Without that, it was just a sandbox I didn’t want to play in.</p>
<p>I became friends with this dude Suleiman in my early 20s. We met at a country club where we were both killing time waiting tables. Me, I was waiting to leave for a year in AmeriCorps. He was waiting for his drug dealing career to take off. Of course, I didn’t know that initially. All I knew was that we got along real well, talked about girls and video games and smoked copious amounts of weed after our shift.</p>
<p>Before a shift, Suleiman handed me a vial of cocaine. I asked him why he did that and he said, “Oh, you try it out for free and if you like it, come back to me. That’s how it works,” and it was then I realized he was a proper dealer. And I remembered the times I gave him rides home and he made multiple stops along the way. And I realized there was no way we could be friends. I never told him, though. I just stopped returning his calls and when he asked to get stoned, I was like, “I’m good. I smoked earlier.”</p>
<p>Before I went to AmeriCorps, I heart through the grapevine that Suleiman was hurt I chose to not be his friend. I wondered if I made the wrong decision. Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Last I heard, he was in prison for murder.</p>
<h2>VI. <em>Star Ocean</em> (SNES)</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I would have loved <em>Star Ocean</em> as much as I loved its sequel on the PlayStation The mix of science fiction and fantasy (think the crew of the USS Enterprise goes back in time and is stranded on a world where magic works), the intense leveling system with dozens of skills to master, the combos, the blend of action and classic RPG. The vast world and frequent random encounters along the way to multiple branching paths.</p>
<p><em>Star Ocean</em> was close to what I liked, but it wasn’t enough. Not quite.</p>
<p>I lived at a frat house my junior year of college. I wasn’t in the frat; my roommates pledged and our house became the party house. It was whatever. I liked the free beer and I didn’t mind the parties, either the open campus ones or the smaller ones with the sister-sorority.</p>
<p>One woman and I became very frequent beer pong collaborators, running the table for nights on end. She got her name, &#8220;Moogle,&#8221; for skipping rush one night to play <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. When we discovered our shared love for the franchise, we tried hanging outside of a party, just to get some food. We both could have used new friends, but we realized that outside of video games and beer pong, we had nothing at all to discuss. Nothing. She didn’t read, I didn’t care about football, she liked school and I was there for the extracurriculars. Her major was one thing, mine another. Democrat, Republican.</p>
<p>It was the first experience that, yeah, I might like someone, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to be tight. I’d grown beyond needing just one or two similarities.</p>
<h2>VII. <em>Twisted Metal</em> (PS)</h2>
<p>I played the heck out of <em>Twisted Metal 2</em> in the &#8217;90s. I learned the ins and outs of all the vehicles. I memorized the courses. With one or two exceptions (I never learned to time the dune-buggy’s jumps and playing as a malevolent clown…no), I mastered the game. So, of course I was excited to try the original Twisted Metal.</p>
<p>Except, sometimes originals aren’t as good. The original <em>Mega Man</em> is basically a crappy <em>Mega Man 2</em>, with hints of a good game inside. <em>Twisted Metal</em> could have been a good game if the graphics had been better, the controls smoother, the handling tighter, the cars more differentiated&#8230; if it had been an entirely different game, in other words.</p>
<p>I went out with Keisha twice. The first time I thought I saw some potential, despite her talking on a cell phone for half of dinner. On the second date, when I saw her take out her phone despite, “Oh, I’ll just be a minute,” I realized that, nope, I was right the first time.</p>
<h2>VIII. <em>Metroid</em> (NES)</h2>
<p>I wound up dating this woman for a few months. Amy was a scientist, an artist. She laughed and taught, ran and painted, and liked <em>Guitar Hero</em> and loved travelling. I liked her. I met her dancing and thought, oh shit, this dating thing worked out. I liked her. A lot. Like, a whole lot.</p>
<p>I never got comfortable. I couldn’t relax. She was, to quote <em>High Fidelity</em>, “Out of my class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. What am I? Average.”</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> was like Amy. Too hard, too complicated, too dangerous, too menacing. When health got low, that damned beeping sounded until either I either died or restored my energy. I lived with that beeping for hours on end. I couldn’t figure out the mazes. I couldn’t find the hidden weapons and passages. I couldn’t time the jumps.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, well, I gave up. I couldn’t get out of my head. I second-guessed myself. I stopped trusting my instincts and signals. I took too much damage, jumped around frantic. And then it ended, poorly.</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> ended the same.</p>
<h2>IX. <em>Advance Wars </em>(DS), <em>Marvel Versus Capcom 2 </em>(PlayStation), <em>Civilization 4</em> (PC), many, many others</h2>
<p>Despite my anxiety, occasional depression, and frequent pessimism, I’m actually quite good in social situations. I know how to talk and bullshit; I have a few different degrees; I watch a bunch of movies, read books. I know stuff. I know what to take seriously and when to show irreverence. This is what made me good at dating, romantically or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the summer of ‘07, I went speed dating. Ten-minute dates played to my strengths and hid my weaknesses. I could reuse jokes and anecdotes and appeal to pop culture, surface-level attraction if there was no ready connection. “I don’t live in the basement. I live in the attic, Greg Brady-style,” I may (definitely) have said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I was asked about children. On a normal first date, I may have hemmed and hawed, but speed dating? “I love kids and they love me. The first time they’re bad, I hold up a single finger. The second time, I punch them hard, between the eyes. Third time? There’s never a third time.”</p>
<p>I was quizzed about my hobbies. “None, really. Mostly pot. And macramé.”</p>
<p>Not particularly hilarious humor aside, of the twenty women, I went on a few follow-up dates. None of them were soul mates, but we had fun times. And I remember them well, along with most of my single-serving or two-to-three-dates-over-two-weeks-before-it-fizzled-into-nothing romantic matches. I remember them, not because of regret or because one “got away,” but because, in one way or another, they all clarified exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>On a coffee date with one of the non-soul mates, Sara, a red-haired, zaftig doctor, genuinely surprised me with a casual insight. We were halfway through our coffee (you date enough, you start scheduling coffee instead of food to save on cash) when she sighed, interrupted whatever I had been saying, and said, “You know, you’re not my normal type.”</p>
<p>I sipped, raised an eyebrow and asked for her to continue.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re funny. I don’t like funny guys. And you work in mental health; I like guys who make more money than me. And also, you’re white.” Her fingers tapped the table continually.</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I am white,” I said, lighting a cigarette and keeping my eyes from rolling.</p>
<p>She pounded the rest of her coffee and asked for a refill. “I exclusively date black dudes.”</p>
<p>I exhaled smoke rings and thought for a moment. “So, let me get this straight. You don’t like funny white dudes who are poor.”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“What about artists? Because I’m an aspiring writer, too.”</p>
<p>She sighed, “God, I hate artists.”</p>
<p>I laughed and signaled for a refill too. “Dude, I can’t imagine why you went on this date, then. Because if you aren’t into those qualities, I literally have nothing else.”</p>
<p>She bummed a smoke from me and we inhaled in unison. The check came and we paid. “Well, I don’t know. You have to try new things, right? We get older and we forget to branch out, you know? But sometimes you know you missed. I mean,” she smiled and put out her hand, “you weren’t that into me either, right?”</p>
<p>I refrained from saying anything that would make this conversation more awkward, and just nodded. I ignored the attraction I felt and pushed it down. Because she was right, besides the purely physical pull I felt toward her, I wasn’t that interested in her.</p>
<p>Until then, my 27th year of life, I’d almost always been after the story. It’s why I went speed-dating, why I went to random raves in warehouses, why I always said yes to whatever weird thing my friends wanted to do. Or I said yes to dates because she was hot. Or because it would look good on a resume. Not always because I enjoyed it. In fact, I would often say yes to events I very well knew I would hate. Because I wanted the story of how much I hated it.</p>
<p>And then, just as we were saying goodbye, she said something banal, but that I just hadn’t thought of until that particular moment in time.</p>
<p>She said, “I’m just too old to waste my time when it isn’t working.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Or Destroying)</p>
<p><b>New York City </b></p>
<p>Travelling south from the jungle twin cities of Boston and Philadelphia, a long trade road dominated by horse and camel hooked east, cutting through two mountain passes, and reached this little desert fortress given the name of New York City. The sand was not flat, the white grains just a thin cover over skyscraping rock. Almost nothing grew, the city relying on a lake and a paltry acre of a river. Grain was imported to its granary and water mill so that it could remotely feed itself. There was the strong suspicion that under those hills, in a thousand years or so, there would be coal, oil, aluminum, or uranium, something to make the spot worth it, but right then, there was nothing but sand and rock. The city scraped by at underpopulated weight, investing in the highest possible walls and the only castle in the empire. No grand wonders or temples. No libraries and no workshops. Just a barracks and a wall sunk in the dirt. Building those alone took decades. New Yorkers were constantly unhappy, on the verge of revolt, kept in check by men holding pikes. Every fifteen years Egyptian armies came streaming through the mountains and attempted to bring down the walls. Little chariots, horsemen, swordsmen, and catapults, all bearing that little yellow and purple flag, would converge on little starving blue New York. And each time, it would somehow survive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Alexandria</b></p>
<p>The Senate told me they wanted Alexandria. It was one of the last objectives. I sent a single legion from Sicily across the Mediterranean, removing the cloud that had concealed it. I landed, but found that Alexandria was not a city, but <i>the</i> city. This, not Rome, was the center of the world. It had the most advanced buildings I had seen, the largest population, overflowing far past the point of my single army being able to take it. It took eight, eight armies, thrown at the same time, to take out the city and its defenses. Even in the battle map, the city was a bright silver monster. It was beautiful, white walls looping to the ocean, The Lighthouse and The Library. I tried to take it intact, occupy the thing without needless destruction or plunder, but then of course, the next turn, the population pressure and unrest was so immense that I was immediately overthrown, and a new flag rose over its battlements and its multitudes. We climbed the walls again, this time taking advantage in the damage they had already suffered, and sacked the city, burning its plazas, its gardens, its forums. I took the greatest city in the world, and worse than destroying it completely, I made it mediocre. I made it nothing. No matter how hard I tried for the rest of time, I couldn’t get Alexandria to what it had been. The numbers would not climb that high. The machine would not let me accomplish what it had. And every other time I played the game, the machine never accomplished it either, never grew it that big. Alexandria never became that Alexandria again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxopolis </b></p>
<p>Steel, granite, and glass reached for the heavens along a long curved peninsula, true downtown lying on a raised plateau overlooking a tropical bay, causing the blue and green and brown buildings to extend higher. Suburban sprawl, fields of factories, spiraled out from the dense center, bedroom communities and farming towns. I sculpted the roads in continual circles, imitating the terrain, a whole city of roundabouts and weird arcs. In the center of the bay, I placed an airport on the island, and its runways sat straight relative to all the other curves, the only semblance of a true grid. Parks lined the beaches. The lights reflected off of the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>London</b></p>
<p>Every natural resource lay naturally within London&#8217;s borders, as if placed by a divine intelligently designing being, which of course, is exactly what had happened. London was playing on an unequal playing field from the start. The stats were juked by geography.</p>
<p>Within the walls, it looked like a twisted version of Vegas. The Pyramids, then the Colossus, then the Hanging Gardens, The Great Wall, The Sistine Chapel, The Hoover Dam, all in a nice little line in the same space. A sentried carrier battle group sat around the island, not even really needing to protect it with the scales of the universe so tipped, the little grey ships an aesthetic accompaniment to the world wonder theme park. The places I am building are not real, I thought. They are chesspieces or block toys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Morgan Industries/Gaia’s Landing </b></p>
<p>Energy collection around Morgan Industries was pushed to its furthest possible extreme. The very elevation of the ground had been raised by terraforming, bringing the solar collectors and echelon mirrors closer to the solar radiation raining down from above. Every form of bank or power generation or resource exploitation was built without concern for environment or cost. Blue magtubes linked it in network with all the other bases of industry, terrain dominated by thermal boreholes and strip mines, only interrupted by the explosions of red and pink fungus, the planet fighting back. It was a city literally trying to buy the world. That was its goal. Buy the world. The whole world. Trade and bargain and short and long and one day take the whole market for yourself.</p>
<p>Across the bay, Gaia’s Landing was surrounded by forest, this shade of pine forming an ocean around its lime and brown core. The same mag tube lines were the only thing interrupting the vegetation. Gaia’s Landing was in perfect symbiosis with its environment, or, I should say, with its human environment. The truth is, if there was an objective truth in that world, the forests were just as much alien invaders as Morgan’s mines. Both were interlopers.</p>
<p>Gaia’s Landing and Morgan Industries were not grown or made under my control. It was the AI behaving in perfect narrative cohesion. Two cities, actually following what the game’s text said they were trying to do, to the letter, ignoring the actual strategic math of their decisions. They built certain improvements for ideology’s sake. They were actors in a play.</p>
<p>And so I played my role, and I did not conquer them. I let them attack the planet in their ways.</p>
<p>I couldn’t play the game much more than that, because with enough knowledge, it became chess. It wasn’t about the stories anymore, even the stories in your head. The minerals and resources were playthings. Ways to win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Londinium</b></p>
<p>Londinium was a maze. Roads, which felt more like paths, danced around square red-roofed buildings before dead ending in fountains or gardens. Figuring out a true path through the city was impossible. The construction of a single grand villa unknowingly severed the main thoroughfare out of the city, and caused the need for a bypass that zigzagged through several temples. Clay pits and pottery shops clung to the river, the smoke from kilns rising each day. The Thames fed reservoirs, aqueducts, and baths. Technicolor plazas ringed the brick apartments and houses. Theaters and schools released their crowds onto the streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Metal Isles</b></p>
<p>The Metal Isles were not meant for a city. They were meant as a battlefield. No living things were there anyway. There were four islands, one in each corner, rectangles that were almost squares, each with a system of pre-built walls which loomed within their interior, all made out of an unending synthenic metal. The game was to defeat your opponent, your robots against theirs. But instead, I built. I built metal and solar collectors, endless lines of turrets and platforms, shipyards and airbases, massive fusion reactors. At a certain point, the base became a city. Eventually my radar extended out to see my opponent across the sea on their own isle. They had built their own city, swarmed over by a shifting cloud of units, flying in circles, unsure whether to assault the citadel I had laid out for them. The enemy did not know what to do. It hit the unit limit, and waited, the clouds on the radar screen never repeating the same pattern twice. And my drones ignored them, and kept building. My little robots tried to make my island perfectly symmetrical. Tried to make everything fit. And winning did not exist.</p>

<p><b>Mentar III </b></p>
<p>Mentar III was a planet, but also a city. I remember looking down on it from space above, seeing every possible building built, every derivation, over its green utopian Gaian-class surface. The technoecological paradise, I remember that green. Whenever I see that particular shade of emerald pop-up in my life, I think, Gaian-class Green. I remember that Mentar III the planet that was also a city was defended by a horde of spaceships that were also almost planets, and also cities. And that I had my own horde of city spaceships, carefully designed and planned as if they were cities, as if they had to eat, and educate, and grow. I remember that Mentar III was the last planet left. The last that was not mine. I remember having to automate the battle because it was too big. I remember the invasion having marines that filled up the screen, little suits up against mechs and men, once again against that shade and against those buildings, or those that had survived the bombardment. Or maybe I’m remembering wrong and I didn’t invade. Maybe I simply bombed it from orbit until nothing was left. Maybe I incinerated the planet itself. Maybe I felt sad about that.</p>

<p><b>Fort Orange</b></p>
<p>The site of Isabella was stolen from the nearby Arawaks by the Spanish Conquistadors. Straight theft, followed up by conquest and plunder. I then stole it from the Spanish. Liberation was not an option. The Spanish had cut down all the trees around Isabella, and there was no terrain suitable for mining, so lumber and ore had to be imported on wagon trades. Professions inside the city had to be carefully micromanaged, turning the carpenter into a preacher or a statesman and then back into a carpenter. It exported sugar. I kept wrestling with whether I actually wanted it or not, considered leaving it undefended in the hopes that someone might take it away, take it back. There was no way to actually destroy it. So it sat. Fortress and all. My city of guilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxstan III</b></p>
<p>It might have been the hundredth city to bear the name of Maxstan. For this one, 80% of the surrounding map was insane fractal mountains, carved from the map editor to resemble the heights of a vengeful god, a treeless organism of dull brown jagged heights. The tool would grab mountains out of a flat plane, raising the dirt and ridges into the sky. Then random cascades of water caved into the center, tributaries flowing both up and down in ways that defied reasonable physics. Two waterfalls fell off of both sides of the tallest peak, without an obvious source for the water’s origin. They were like aqua volcanoes. The city tapped them for power, little grey dams reaching up the valley walls, residential neighborhoods squeezed into every flat space available. I was able to get it up to 12,000 people, roads clinging to the edges and crests to connect the little mesas of industrial zones or office parks. In the center of the map, the center of the city, every possible municipal headquarters was crammed onto a plateau, parks and police stations and city hall sharing the space with almost no room for embellishment.</p>
<p>Then one day, with land and population and tax revenue maxed out, Maxstan fell. The seals opened one by one. A new set of plagues. First, fire. The blaze climbed the summits and bit the little structures, leaving rubble and choking the city. Then the water came too, flooding from all angles. Then the planes fell out of the sky, the winds rose and a tornado carved the city center into nothing. The earth shook, and the rains came, and then the four armed, red-eyed monster descended from above, and snuffed Maxstan into nothing, the abandoned buildings of the fleeing citizens blinking from not having any power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxstan II </b></p>
<p>It was probably not the second Maxstan, more like the twentieth. It had a long lake down the center, the shore of which I had absolutely saturated with water pumps. Maxstan was the most watered city in the world, galactic capital of plumbing. I liked the little animation of the water pumping, the ropes of light going dark blue and then light. I built boulevards around the water, avenues to the god of the fluid, blue gold. The whole city emanating from that shining, pumping core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxstan I</b></p>
<p>The only thing I remember is that the natural gas powerplant blew up because it was too old, and I didn’t have the money to replace it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Athens </b></p>
<p>The little island protected Athens from my rivals. It was the approximate size of, say, Iceland, at that sort of scale, a green interior surrounded by mountains along the coast. Athens lay at the bottom, where the river met the shoreline. I had played the game dozens of times, thinking that it was merely a simulation of ancient times. I had always played as the Greeks, always started with little Athens, and never got much further than building a temple and a barracks and cranking out a few militia and founding Sparta and Delphi. But this one time, on that island, Athens was destined to be more. I remember the feeling of discovering gunpowder, of building a bank, an aqueduct, a coliseum. Of wondering, how far does this go? And not actually knowing the answer. I remember first discovering that the island was an island, my horseman scouting those last hills, understanding that my three cities would be unthreatened from Stalin or Gandhi, that it was just building from here.</p>
<p>By the end, you could look at Athens from the hill, the first city I remember building, looking more like a midwestern town than a megacity, a collection of repeated non-descript red and blue pixelated buildings only interrupted by a Cathedral or the towering rocket of the Apollo program. It was not clear to me then if I was actually building the city or if the game was. What my decisions meant for the place, as much as it was a place. Or where exactly the place existed, other than my head. I don’t know what happened to Athens. I don’t remember.</p>
