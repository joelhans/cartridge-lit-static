								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am gunning down Iraqi soldiers. Later<br />
in the poem they will be American soldiers,<br />
though the difference is simply textural:</p>
<p>their hidden wireframes are no different,<br />
their polygonal bullets pierce the same,<br />
their movements still awkward and jerky,</p>
<p>their blood a misty blip of cartoon red.<br />
It’s easy to feel nothing for these bodies<br />
that disappear before they hit the ground.</p>
<p>They could belong to the young men<br />
of any region. But at this desert mosque<br />
I know they are simulations of Iraqis.</p>
<p>In 2003, Jesse Petrilla developed<br />
<i>Quest for Saddam,</i> a first-person shooter<br />
where the player storms a crude temple</p>
<p>and viciously rips through scores<br />
of turban-crowned enemies. On the walls<br />
hang pixelated pictures of Saddam in lingerie.</p>
<p>There are “Camel-Cola” vending machines,<br />
obscene references to goats, and crates<br />
of “Made in France” gasmasks.</p>
<p>Three years after that game’s release,<br />
al-Qaeda game developers responded with<br />
<i>Night of Bush Capturing</i>. It’s identical</p>
<p>to the aforementioned game in form, design,<br />
and content except the images of Saddam<br />
are replaced with images of President Bush,</p>
<p>the soldiers have been visually altered<br />
to resemble Americans, and Saddam—<br />
the former final boss—is now Bush himself</p>
<p>eyes wide and  mouth agape in<br />
unsubtle mockery.  Now I am gunning down<br />
American soldiers who were once</p>
<p>Iraqi soldiers, though again the difference<br />
is simply textural: their hidden wireframes<br />
are unchanged, their polygonal bullets</p>
<p>pierce the same, their movements still<br />
awkward and jerky, their blood still a misty<br />
blip of cartoon red. It’s easy to feel nothing</p>
<p>for these bodies disappearing before<br />
they hit the ground. They could belong<br />
to the young men of any region,</p>
<p>but at this desert base I know they are<br />
simulations of Americans. A <i>re-skin: </i><i><br />
</i>a developer drapes their own imagery</p>
<p>over the stanzas of a game, garbing<br />
a tiny unsafe reality. The simple buildings<br />
were not altered. The trigger you pull</p>
<p>delivers an equivalent kick. Each soldier<br />
requires the same number of bullets<br />
before crumping with an identical scream.mp3.<strong><br />
