								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Skull Kid’s Lament for the Dead</strong></p>
<p>Great world sinker they called<br />
as you shaved your eyebrows</p>
<p>&amp; gifted me the three jewels.<br />
The dog headed. The horse headed.</p>
<p>The owl headed. The world tree<br />
spat out three nuts. These nuts</p>
<p>grew into you, me, &amp;<br />
another tree. The upstart</p>
<p>tree truly believed in love.<br />
It truly wished to see adults</p>
<p>die. I led people into the forest<br />
&amp; they died. I truly hate adults.</p>
<p>The Gorons have allied<br />
with the King of Hyrule.</p>
<p>But the command is swallow, every<br />
time. The Hylians do not eat rock!</p>
<p>The Hylians do not eat rock!<br />
Your eyebrows are waterfowl,</p>
<p>your tunic my resting place.<br />
Tie me to your shoe; I would sink with you.</p>
<p>You are strong enough to find the worm.<br />
You are strong enough to eat my stew.</p>
<p>How boring the people of all nations<br />
come together. Either imperialism or</p>
<p>communism. I don&#8217;t care for the end<br />
of this game. Every struggle is the struggle</p>
<p>for the maintenance of heterosexuality.<br />
Can it be otherwise while the jewels</p>
<p>spill from your nose &amp; into my loving chute.<br />
Can we mages dream? i.e. a ghost</p>
<p>chitters in the field &amp; you kill it<br />
&amp; its lantern falls &amp; starts no small fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Runescape</strong></p>
<p>What dragon is between us?<br />
Drop party. You in teal armor.<br />
You in bark armor. Archer kills me</p>
<p>in forest and I lose your<br />
ring. I mine coal and you<br />
give me a ring and we marry.</p>
<p>First sexual encounter.<br />
Private chat this purpled text.<br />
Bury my giant bones. Your prayer</p>
<p>level and fishing and cut right<br />
across the desert. We are just<br />
underneath the beginners. When</p>
<p>fields are cast with slaughtered<br />
goblins? The year Sk8r Boi<br />
came out we killed</p>
<p>a vampire together. What we found<br />
in his basement. Switches on<br />
off. Daily you take me to runes</p>
<p>and god words and black-armored<br />
knights. I mine silver and you cook<br />
a pie in the public house. My red bar.</p>
<p>Loading screen takes for ever.<br />
These hunters keep arrowing the wilds.<br />
Squeeze through. Take me. On. Sugar</p>
<p>battle axe lag. My DPS into<br />
you. If you arrow me here I will<br />
leave behind all but three items.</p>

<p><strong>The Tides of an Un-Winnable War Are Upon Us</strong></p>
<p>%uh<br />
Don’t care who<br />
Country <span style="margin-left: 110px;">the weak</span><br />
Recent events to be sure<br />
Call to resign<br />
No <span style="margin-left: 35px;">human did not</span><br />
parents just about done<br />
While you’re at it<br />
Fetish our common history<br />
Time greater conflict has two<br />
Against us threatening to destroy<br />
All have accomplished<br />
Many Nations Individual<br />
Now hawks act tired<br />
Open on <span style="margin-left: 50px;">the winnable are upon us</span><br />
Refuge on higher ground<br />
Lest we be swept away to receive<br />
Whatever protection once provided<br />
Man memory<br />
With our enemies left unchecked<br />
You turned <span style="margin-left: 100px;">action cash</span><br />
Rock we have <span style="margin-left: 82px;">storming gowns</span><br />
Now mine said go on manage no me<br />
Hard time just a row in June<br />
Humana denies spring already<br />
How many times to decide actions<br />
Carolina’s come show<br />
Morning <span style="margin-left: 46px;">we three shall watch over you</span><br />
From this day forward that no human make war upon any other human<br />
Let me know tear <span style="margin-left: 46px;">and conspire</span><br />
Against this new beginning<br />
Let no man consort with the evening hours<br />
At all <span style="margin-left: 13px;">the enemies</span> <span style="margin-left: 32px;">of humanity</span><br />
Seek not<br />
Far away ball <span style="margin-left: 19px;">we show</span> winds <span style="margin-left: 100px;">through</span><br />
No matter <span style="margin-left: 100px;">no cost</span></p>
