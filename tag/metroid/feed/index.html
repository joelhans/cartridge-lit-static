								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samus Aran, the female protagonist of Nintendo’s <i>Metroid</i> series, has known and encountered countless deaths on the alien planet Zebes. In Owen Vince’s chapbook, <i><a href="http://fathombooks.org/html/vince.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Adrift of Samus Aran</a>, </i>planet and body meet in the formlessness of death, and something entirely new emerges.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">ZEBES has entered</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">our bodies</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">as Dirt                    Enters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">our bodies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">i want to be nothing more</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">than Dirt, entering</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">a body</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">[ as ] myriad ways beneath</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">the planet’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">arm ;</p>
<p>In a series of fifteen sparse poems that flit across the page like half-remembered meditations, Vince’s speaker visits the psychic remnants of their life, the intersections and edges of their experience within a landscape that has turned them into “a / Body rounded / to Zero.” The speaker comes to understand their body as a sort of aftershock of trauma, that “i am carrying what / remains / of sense, deft logic” and questioning: “What of skin that fills an entire sub-subterranean / cavern   What of that?”</p>
<p>The problem of the mutated and cumulative body seems a critical thread in this short collection, as Vince’s speaker grapples as a scientist would with the realities and mysteries of their physical and spiritual existence. The <i>Metroid </i>games (pre-<i>Prime</i> series) take place in a 2D space, with the world laid out in four directions (up, down, left, right). Samus Aran, however, is able to move diagonally through the world as well, thus expanding her navigational possibilities to eight directions. Vince seems to take this game mechanic and explore its affective implications—this human aberration on an alien planet. In one poem, the speaker steps into an observational role to wonder at “the manner in which you under / penetrate the coherence of this – corpus, pale golden / hair under your arm.” As a glitch in the logic of Zebes, the speaker is able to conclude:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">on Zebes i would die</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">in Eight directions – on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Zebes i would ascertain</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">that death is a program</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">insufficient</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">to complete the program</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">it describes ;</p>
<p>Perhaps the glitch is the human body itself and its desires. Though the body suffuses the text, it is mostly in strange amalgamations of terrain (“the smashed / oesophagus / of the Glacier”). Perhaps the most purely human anatomy within the text is the speaker’s hands, which can be traced in stages of being clasped, unclasped, “unbound, and so careless they just hang there.” If the hands can function as a stand-in for the body, then it is not until the speaker has psychically removed themselves (“the undersides of the hands / are far below me”) that they are able to become “lost in the highways / of the Landscape” and reach a point “where you will say, ‘I am done.’”</p>
<p>In <i>The Adrift of Samus Aran, </i>Vince’s speaker slowly dissolves into the landscape where they have met with death and the multiplicities of self. By the end of the chapbook, the “I” has nearly disappeared and this reader is left with an image:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">often,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">the woman will climb</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">into the window</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">until her body is no longer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">framed by it ;</p>
<p>Here is an artist who disassembles the framework of the video game and organically mixes virtual landscape, character, and body to explore death as a means of dispersal and contamination in line with a necropastoral poetics. Owen Vince’s collection can easily be read in one sitting, yet I found myself coming back to it again and again, wanting to float with its speaker through their strange world and sift through the ruined intersections between poetry and video game.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year and a half, since writing <em>Retrogamer</em>, I’ve played quite a few games, many because I legitimately wanted to play, or because they were highly recommended, but also because I thought people wanted to read about it. And I gave them a fair try, but I couldn’t get into them, not enough to write a long piece about how much I hated them. I could barely muster the energy to finish an hour or two of these games, with one notable exception.</p>
<p>But, welcome to speed dating for video games.</p>
<h2><strong>I.</strong><em><strong> Halo 2</strong></em><strong> (Xbox)</strong></h2>
<p>I liked <em>Contra</em> and I liked <em>Goldeneye</em>. I even liked the original <em>Halo</em> when it first came out, despite minimal playing time (I was in college). I liked <em>Fortress</em> and all those early PvP games played on college servers. I fully expected to like <em>Halo 2</em>, especially now that I was giving myself time to really dig into it. But, I realized very quickly that I have better things to do than map out attack patterns for exploitation and the exact steps to run a gauntlet while following directions from some dippy AI named Cortana.</p>
<p>The crux of this is that I’m missing something with first-person shooters. I know I am. And Halo, for all the trappings of science fiction joy, is still an FPS at its core. And that core is not what I dig. It’s dying and resetting and figuring out exactly where the enemies are located. It’s repetition and brute memorization. That’s not a game; that’s like learning multiplication tables.</p>
<p><em>Halo 2</em> reminded me of Cecily, the sweet Filipino-American woman I went on a single date with. She was tall and lithe and had delightfully dirty stories; she had a good job and a lovely kid that she showed me a picture of. She also had a dagger-field of topics I couldn’t discuss (politics, music, books, her family, sports, the Philippines) and jokes I couldn’t make, because she liked being the funny person in the room. I probably could have figured out the pattern, but, like <em>Halo 2</em>, I simply couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<h2>II. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, I lived with Jason, a recovering heroin addict. He spent a lot of time on the couch, playing GameCube and often, when leaving or coming home, I’d hang out with him and chain smoke cigarettes. While I’d sometimes play <em>Mario Party</em> with him, mostly I watched him play <em>Metroid Prime</em> and <em>Phantasy Star</em>. I liked him.</p>
<p>He died a few years later of a heroin overdose. I found out later, through friends of friends, because I had moved out of the house as soon as I put all the pieces together. Why our money was disappearing, why his friends were using our bathroom for an hour at a time, why a cop showed up at our early in the morning for no particular reason. This isn’t strictly related, but it feels that way. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> played like I imagined a heroin overdose would feel: slow, stultifying, mind-numbing, a product of poor decisions.</p>
<p>Phantasy Star 0 was half a hundred things warning signs, like platforming and weapon farming and minimal storyline. Warning signs I followed.</p>
<h2>III. <em>Final Fantasy III</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>Another victim of the blocky isometric necessity of the early aughts. What was the fixation with that crap? The load times that were put into the game in order to have these square-headed, lopsided monstrosities. Call me old-fashioned, call me a luddite, but I like my old-school RPGs, well, old school: pixels, cartridge-based, non-existent load times.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that <em>Final Fantasy III</em> is unplayable. I’ll track down a different re-mastered version and play that, one without 45-second load times between every single battle and dungeon. Especially on a portable platform, one that’s meant to be quick and easy.</p>
<h2>IV. <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>(PS3)</h2>
<p>Why didn’t I like <em>Mass Effect 2</em>? Why did I play it for three or four hours, put the controller down and simply never come back to it? I enjoyed the intro and the interface. I was engaged. It even felt like my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Sarah was a doctoral candidate in psychology, she liked <em>Dance, Dance, Dance</em> and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>. She had an adorable cat and a 1950s time capsule for an apartment. All stuff I dig.</p>
<p>After our second date, after we kissed in her doorway, I went away for a week. And then she had a conference. And then with one thing another, three months passed before we spoke again. By that time, she’d started dating her old friends-with-benefits and now they’re married. I&#8217;m happy for them.</p>
<p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was, on the surface, everything I looked for in a video game. But sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes people and places and games slip away, one moment at a time, until, with a look around, there’s a realization that time has moved on and if there was a space, that space has been filled.</p>
<h2>V. <em>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</em> (PS2)</h2>
<p>This was disappointing. <em>Fallout 3</em> was what re-ignited my love of video games in the first place. I knew it was based on the <em>Morrowind </em>engine and modeled around the same open world, quest-based fulcrum that enthralled me. And I love high fantasy, so this was obviously a win-win. But it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Turns out I no longer love high fantasy—not without irony or deviation from norms. I didn’t even make it out of the first town. The spark that drove me in <em>Fallout</em>—the gallows humor and meta-reference—was missing in <em>Morrowind</em>. Without that, it was just a sandbox I didn’t want to play in.</p>
<p>I became friends with this dude Suleiman in my early 20s. We met at a country club where we were both killing time waiting tables. Me, I was waiting to leave for a year in AmeriCorps. He was waiting for his drug dealing career to take off. Of course, I didn’t know that initially. All I knew was that we got along real well, talked about girls and video games and smoked copious amounts of weed after our shift.</p>
<p>Before a shift, Suleiman handed me a vial of cocaine. I asked him why he did that and he said, “Oh, you try it out for free and if you like it, come back to me. That’s how it works,” and it was then I realized he was a proper dealer. And I remembered the times I gave him rides home and he made multiple stops along the way. And I realized there was no way we could be friends. I never told him, though. I just stopped returning his calls and when he asked to get stoned, I was like, “I’m good. I smoked earlier.”</p>
<p>Before I went to AmeriCorps, I heart through the grapevine that Suleiman was hurt I chose to not be his friend. I wondered if I made the wrong decision. Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Last I heard, he was in prison for murder.</p>
<h2>VI. <em>Star Ocean</em> (SNES)</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I would have loved <em>Star Ocean</em> as much as I loved its sequel on the PlayStation The mix of science fiction and fantasy (think the crew of the USS Enterprise goes back in time and is stranded on a world where magic works), the intense leveling system with dozens of skills to master, the combos, the blend of action and classic RPG. The vast world and frequent random encounters along the way to multiple branching paths.</p>
<p><em>Star Ocean</em> was close to what I liked, but it wasn’t enough. Not quite.</p>
<p>I lived at a frat house my junior year of college. I wasn’t in the frat; my roommates pledged and our house became the party house. It was whatever. I liked the free beer and I didn’t mind the parties, either the open campus ones or the smaller ones with the sister-sorority.</p>
<p>One woman and I became very frequent beer pong collaborators, running the table for nights on end. She got her name, &#8220;Moogle,&#8221; for skipping rush one night to play <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. When we discovered our shared love for the franchise, we tried hanging outside of a party, just to get some food. We both could have used new friends, but we realized that outside of video games and beer pong, we had nothing at all to discuss. Nothing. She didn’t read, I didn’t care about football, she liked school and I was there for the extracurriculars. Her major was one thing, mine another. Democrat, Republican.</p>
<p>It was the first experience that, yeah, I might like someone, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to be tight. I’d grown beyond needing just one or two similarities.</p>
<h2>VII. <em>Twisted Metal</em> (PS)</h2>
<p>I played the heck out of <em>Twisted Metal 2</em> in the &#8217;90s. I learned the ins and outs of all the vehicles. I memorized the courses. With one or two exceptions (I never learned to time the dune-buggy’s jumps and playing as a malevolent clown…no), I mastered the game. So, of course I was excited to try the original Twisted Metal.</p>
<p>Except, sometimes originals aren’t as good. The original <em>Mega Man</em> is basically a crappy <em>Mega Man 2</em>, with hints of a good game inside. <em>Twisted Metal</em> could have been a good game if the graphics had been better, the controls smoother, the handling tighter, the cars more differentiated&#8230; if it had been an entirely different game, in other words.</p>
<p>I went out with Keisha twice. The first time I thought I saw some potential, despite her talking on a cell phone for half of dinner. On the second date, when I saw her take out her phone despite, “Oh, I’ll just be a minute,” I realized that, nope, I was right the first time.</p>
<h2>VIII. <em>Metroid</em> (NES)</h2>
<p>I wound up dating this woman for a few months. Amy was a scientist, an artist. She laughed and taught, ran and painted, and liked <em>Guitar Hero</em> and loved travelling. I liked her. I met her dancing and thought, oh shit, this dating thing worked out. I liked her. A lot. Like, a whole lot.</p>
<p>I never got comfortable. I couldn’t relax. She was, to quote <em>High Fidelity</em>, “Out of my class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. What am I? Average.”</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> was like Amy. Too hard, too complicated, too dangerous, too menacing. When health got low, that damned beeping sounded until either I either died or restored my energy. I lived with that beeping for hours on end. I couldn’t figure out the mazes. I couldn’t find the hidden weapons and passages. I couldn’t time the jumps.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, well, I gave up. I couldn’t get out of my head. I second-guessed myself. I stopped trusting my instincts and signals. I took too much damage, jumped around frantic. And then it ended, poorly.</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> ended the same.</p>
<h2>IX. <em>Advance Wars </em>(DS), <em>Marvel Versus Capcom 2 </em>(PlayStation), <em>Civilization 4</em> (PC), many, many others</h2>
<p>Despite my anxiety, occasional depression, and frequent pessimism, I’m actually quite good in social situations. I know how to talk and bullshit; I have a few different degrees; I watch a bunch of movies, read books. I know stuff. I know what to take seriously and when to show irreverence. This is what made me good at dating, romantically or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the summer of ‘07, I went speed dating. Ten-minute dates played to my strengths and hid my weaknesses. I could reuse jokes and anecdotes and appeal to pop culture, surface-level attraction if there was no ready connection. “I don’t live in the basement. I live in the attic, Greg Brady-style,” I may (definitely) have said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I was asked about children. On a normal first date, I may have hemmed and hawed, but speed dating? “I love kids and they love me. The first time they’re bad, I hold up a single finger. The second time, I punch them hard, between the eyes. Third time? There’s never a third time.”</p>
<p>I was quizzed about my hobbies. “None, really. Mostly pot. And macramé.”</p>
<p>Not particularly hilarious humor aside, of the twenty women, I went on a few follow-up dates. None of them were soul mates, but we had fun times. And I remember them well, along with most of my single-serving or two-to-three-dates-over-two-weeks-before-it-fizzled-into-nothing romantic matches. I remember them, not because of regret or because one “got away,” but because, in one way or another, they all clarified exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>On a coffee date with one of the non-soul mates, Sara, a red-haired, zaftig doctor, genuinely surprised me with a casual insight. We were halfway through our coffee (you date enough, you start scheduling coffee instead of food to save on cash) when she sighed, interrupted whatever I had been saying, and said, “You know, you’re not my normal type.”</p>
<p>I sipped, raised an eyebrow and asked for her to continue.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re funny. I don’t like funny guys. And you work in mental health; I like guys who make more money than me. And also, you’re white.” Her fingers tapped the table continually.</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I am white,” I said, lighting a cigarette and keeping my eyes from rolling.</p>
<p>She pounded the rest of her coffee and asked for a refill. “I exclusively date black dudes.”</p>
<p>I exhaled smoke rings and thought for a moment. “So, let me get this straight. You don’t like funny white dudes who are poor.”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“What about artists? Because I’m an aspiring writer, too.”</p>
<p>She sighed, “God, I hate artists.”</p>
<p>I laughed and signaled for a refill too. “Dude, I can’t imagine why you went on this date, then. Because if you aren’t into those qualities, I literally have nothing else.”</p>
<p>She bummed a smoke from me and we inhaled in unison. The check came and we paid. “Well, I don’t know. You have to try new things, right? We get older and we forget to branch out, you know? But sometimes you know you missed. I mean,” she smiled and put out her hand, “you weren’t that into me either, right?”</p>
<p>I refrained from saying anything that would make this conversation more awkward, and just nodded. I ignored the attraction I felt and pushed it down. Because she was right, besides the purely physical pull I felt toward her, I wasn’t that interested in her.</p>
<p>Until then, my 27th year of life, I’d almost always been after the story. It’s why I went speed-dating, why I went to random raves in warehouses, why I always said yes to whatever weird thing my friends wanted to do. Or I said yes to dates because she was hot. Or because it would look good on a resume. Not always because I enjoyed it. In fact, I would often say yes to events I very well knew I would hate. Because I wanted the story of how much I hated it.</p>
<p>And then, just as we were saying goodbye, she said something banal, but that I just hadn’t thought of until that particular moment in time.</p>
<p>She said, “I’m just too old to waste my time when it isn’t working.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SR388. The planet Zebes. A directive read <span style="font-size: 1rem;">EMERGENCY ORDER: DESTROY THE MOTHER<br />BRAIN              THE MECHANICAL LIFE VEIN</span></p>
<p>I drop from Charter Zed like a spacehawk. Portal One homes me in the hive.<br />Tourian.</p>
<p>Never a footfall this ringing nor reapers of this cast. One lanced the air to halves,<br />burst to shreds after his first attempt to fell me. GET UP I got up.</p>
<p>A glittering cave and furs blown in a breezeless passage. Machines to spawn,<br />spawn, spawn each hateful thing. Creatures that move in circles though they can<br />see.</p>
<p>I waxed a valenced enemy to ones like these, mawkish and mutant, I shot them<br />bodiless, a bunch of vapors in the cool. So it continued: new raptors, ghost bricks,<br />a face on four stems.</p>
<p>Pixilated and heavy, I leap and infer topography from leaps—ice is best for<br />heights. I learned to molt by molting.</p>
<p>Believe this: I found the making of bombs tucked in a statue’s niche, took it. I’m<br />alone in weird music. I go fuzzy at cuts. A fissure finds me sunk and wishing. I<br />strengthen still.</p>
<p>The acolytes, the sheer number of lackeys! I plod on, blaster in hand, red-white—<br />this my pith, being right. Norfair. Brinstar. The pirates raise arms to fight. Down to<br />Kraid’s endless clutch of potted mouths, back from Ridley’s mantis beams, I lay<br />waste.</p>
<p>Glims drip in purple; ledges make land; halls hang in forged temperature; I’m a<br />pyrotechnic in tuck, sister. I swell to hero, full of kills. I’d have the beasts on and<br />off me.</p>
<p>In the Metroid den, I ran.</p>
<p>They smelled me like siphons, hulking, their hunger a heart. One took the corner<br />like a freed cheetah.</p>
<p><em>Hurry up please it’s time</em><br /><em>Hurry up please it’s time</em></p>
<p>Coils poured out in an unnatural rain. Blasting and tumbled, bounties forgot,<br />slowed to an inch of space-time in the heat of her breeding, I hunted for lasting in<br />this wasted place. <em>Does it matter if the planet</em>, I wondered. <em>Does it matter if I matter.</em><br />Never wondered if it matters to be a man, however.</p>
