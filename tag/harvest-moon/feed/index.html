								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Congratulations, Computer!<br />
</strong><em>Street Fighter 2 (Ode to Chun-Li) </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Long before I could lace sneakers<br />
and bike without training wheels,<br />
I understood how to buy violence</p>
<p>like instinct: feed the arcade<br />
cabinet’s slot a silver Washington;<br />
punch the red button that signals</p>
<p>Start; select Dhalsim, Zangief, Ryu,<br />
usually Blanka the green beast<br />
from Brazil, though never Chun-Li.</p>
<p>The mallrats called her names<br />
I didn’t know, said she’s designed<br />
for girls to play and boys to ogle</p>
<p>or beat. With Blanka’s gnarled claws,<br />
I could K.O. Ken—the fair-skinned<br />
blonde boy who fought by the docks—</p>
<p>but Chun-Li’s Hundred Rending<br />
Kicks hauled my fevered monster<br />
to corner screen like a sandlot bully</p>
<p>who groped the wrong girl. If Chun-Li<br />
was built to beat on, why did she fight<br />
more relentless than her swollen male</p>
<p>counterparts? Didn’t my defeat assume<br />
her name and figure? Baby blue skirt,<br />
brocaded ox horns, sheer panty hose</p>
<p>hugging her most sinister weapon:<br />
sledgehammer legs bashing Blanka’s<br />
brain ‘til golden chicks fog his vision.</p>
<p>Congratulations, computer. <em>Perfect<br />
</em>still flashes after every bout against<br />
Chun-Li. Thank you for teaching me</p>
<p>to treat thighs with reverence, to never<br />
underestimate giggly girls in short skirts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations, Computer!<br />
</strong><em>Harvest Moon (Nintendo 64)</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s easier to land the hottest girl in town when you serve her<br />
</em><em>some of that special soup in the kitchen of your giant mansion. – Aaron Boulding, IGN </em></p>
<p>Once per lifetime,<br />
you may trade fish<br />
for the blessing<br />
of the Lake Goddess.<br />
Successfully hook the elusive<br />
blue trout, throw it back.<br />
The Goddess emerges,<br />
green-haired specter<br />
over water, and boosts<br />
your choice bachelorette’s<br />
affection fifty points.</p>
<p>Say Karen’s the reason<br />
you give gold<br />
to the bar. Next time<br />
you’re floating eye<br />
-balls deep in merlot,<br />
her heart will swell<br />
a shade brighter—banter<br />
perfumed in flattery<br />
as she refills your glass.<br />
You fight to keep face<br />
from smashing table.</p>
<p>If she remarks sour, if she’s<br />
not one big-bright-sunshine<br />
emoji, the system’s<br />
haywire. Bachelorettes<br />
with high affection<br />
should never speak ill<br />
of your presence. You’re the hero.<br />
Barring crackpot anomalies,<br />
gifting’s best for winning<br />
a woman’s bubblegum heart.</p>
<p>Most women love two things<br />
tops. Karen loves wine<br />
and fish: ten points each.<br />
With fresh caught<br />
fish writhing in hands,<br />
hoof it to her house<br />
every evening unannounced<br />
for one year.<br />
If she’s not home,<br />
sprint to the bar before close.</p>
<p>Nudge Karen’s noggin with fish<br />
to gift her on the clock.<br />
Her awe and surprise<br />
won’t diminish, no matter<br />
how often you do this.<br />
If she sighs or rolls eyes<br />
after your thousandth fish,<br />
the game’s glitched. Women<br />
never grow sick of gifts,<br />
least of all yours. Assuming</p>
<p>the system works, her heart<br />
will turn pink by summer. See pink<br />
valentine flash when she speaks?<br />
Call the lumber<br />
-jack, order King-Size Bed,<br />
wait one week,<br />
and remember to deliver<br />
fish—by the satchel<br />
if you can. Once the bed’s installed,<br />
scour General Store<br />
for Blue Feather. This is classified</p>
<p>under Tools, like Axe, Hammer,<br />
and Watering Can.<br />
Next time you see Karen,<br />
wield the Feather<br />
to propose, and don’t forget<br />
to give her fish!<br />
If you own the King-Size Bed<br />
and her heart’s pink,<br />
she’s 100% guaranteed<br />
to say yes. If she rejects you,</p>
<p>reset system. Call mother.<br />
Increase fish-gifting<br />
to ten satchels daily.<br />
She’ll only say yes<br />
after receiving enough fish.<br />
If the game functions<br />
properly, you’ll kiss Karen<br />
outside the white-steeple<br />
church on Sunday.<br />
Once you shack, do not slack.<br />
For healthy marriage<br />
and children, bring home</p>
<p>fish: as many and often<br />
as foreseeable. You’re the provider.<br />
This means fishing away<br />
hours in the most sinister weather.<br />
This means packing home<br />
to the gills with fish for famine<br />
or flood. Your domestic<br />
success rests on a fridge<br />
overflowing with fish,<br />
cupboards choking in fish,</p>
<p>fish bleeding out the windows,<br />
oozing from front door<br />
to flowerbed for neighbors<br />
to marvel. Do not tire<br />
‘til wedding bed and baby’s crib<br />
are buried in fish.<br />
The Familial Dream trophy<br />
will remain unattained<br />
‘til you, wife, and child drown<br />
beneath your catch.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gotz</strong></p>
<p>On the outskirts of town, in a timber house<br />
too large for one, I can find you on your own.<br />
Head down at the lathe or tablesaw, gaze fixed,</p>
<p>your hands rough and steady. You make tables,<br />
cut lumber, upgrade the town hall. All furnishings<br />
pass through your palms. The woods are in you.</p>
<p>Your crown of chestnut hair, your knotted fists,<br />
your thick trunk ringed with winters. I am thankful<br />
you came to my farm to chop the oak blocking</p>
<p>the forest path. I say so and touch you, grazing<br />
the bark of your elbow. But then, you are telling me<br />
of the blizzard, your words bursting like a storm,</p>
<p>blow through and bury so fast, leaving only snow<br />
silence. You rattle off sums: the measure of coffins,<br />
of time spent sanding wood that would hold a wife,</p>
<p>a child, and carry them to where you could not go.<br />
You dreamed of returning to the earth with your kin.<br />
And then, snow silence. You pursed your thin lips,</p>
<p>flexed your weary arms. A tree chopped down,<br />
its branches used for bar stools. Its white heart<br />
turned into a cross to mark a family grave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gamification</strong></p>
<p>When you will try anything,<br />
you can turn your body into a game.</p>
<p>Remember to feed it pills daily,<br />
star any chart on an app. Pee on sticks<br />
first thing each day. Aim carefully.<br />
Wait a fixed amount of time.<br />
You can play every game alone.</p>
<p>Months pass while you stick at it,<br />
then years. Others have moved on<br />
to the sequel, the next big thing.<br />
But you persist. You are so close.</p>
<p>You hope for a level-up, new content.<br />
You aim to defeat the boss. Save<br />
the princess. But the boss is you,<br />
and you are the princess too.</p>
<p>And no matter how many hours<br />
you put in, you start each day<br />
again at the beginning.<br />
You cannot make new life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>lately has been smoldering, sun-beat-heavy on tin roofs thick in pines. river has gathered velocity and steam on its journey down the mountain, has reached its hands into lakes and raised water like dead. crops have disappeared in rows of teeth. fields of cotton dream in green.</p>
<p>lately cats are stirring, are slipping under doorways and around windowframes, gnawing through melted doorknobs and the walls of houses release a deep sigh. with the ghosts of river and flame surging their veins, cats have death-sprinted circles through the trees, shrieking through the night. the moon has turned a deep red, has birthed new star formations in preparation for a pending doom.</p>
<p>well bottoms have dried, have heard the baritone rumble of river and evaporated into counter-melody. villagers wake to a death march, to a song broke free from the ground. seeking water, the roots of homes have lifted families whole into the river, embedded themselves in burning mud and the families swept downstream into clouds of smoke.</p>
<p>cats step sideways over mounds of sleeping villagers struck down by a sudden wave of midday heat. they have been seen carrying small children in their mouths off into the trees, have left behind messages smeared in mud on windowpanes—<em>let go; sleep now; the heat inside will save you</em>.</p>
<p>refusing to carry madness, the wind has ceased. it has fallen from the sky in shreds of warm wet paper. it has been caught in pine branches and hangs down like moss. villagers place pots and pans under to catch the drips, to use a water untainted by river.</p>
<hr />
<p>it has been weeks since anyone has seen a cat. the dogs of the village have become inactive, have been heard hacking imaginary hairballs the color of blood. have stayed outside, mostly, and wandered into underground tunnels when the wind is highest, when the river swells and the ground flash-fires.</p>
<p>travelers from the bleached interstate have reported mirages of felines skulking the tops of pine boughs, bending the thinnest branches with the weight of their anger, sun-fury. the roads have buckled, they say, and have been known to arc animals off their backs high into a weary sky whose color is worn and forgotten.</p>
<p>villagers have wandered into the trees in search of cats, carrying signs of their departure with them. returning with less, they speak in long silences of pinecones unfurling in heat-blossoms and streaking down as comets, of cats with shaman-green eyes incanting the air with swishing tails, and of a peace felt in grey river water.</p>
<hr />
<p>the returned villagers say there is nothing beyond the midday horizon of heat, where the present moment muddies into other dimensions. the cats, they say, know this with an instinct ungrounded in any knowledge found in the village library.</p>
<p>reports have not returned—armadillos wrapped in aluminum foil—sent out to judge the length between here and the road ending in distance. where the river swallows the road and touches the sky is an open mouth, sleeping. it is time, they say, to sleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>I climb from the bottom of a well-dream to a house which is a cave which is melting in clumps. I awake to a cat on a ledge which was a window which is a hole in the sky. cat, lithe as pine-sway, coils into a sun-spring and begins its long summer sleep.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My disc of <em>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</em> is missing. I opened the box with the intention of playing for the first time in almost five years, and it was empty. I&#8217;m pretty sure I left it in my Game Cube, the one my ex from college found in his attic crawl space and painted orange and re-gifted to me for Christmas the second unhappy year we spent together; the one my ex from after college made me leave in the basement of our apartment building that looked like a dirty sand castle because I never played it anymore and wasn&#8217;t it just taking up space and didn&#8217;t I have too many objects tying me to other people I&#8217;ve loved and what was the point of a virtual farm in the first place.</p>
<p>The disc to <em>A Wonderful Life</em> is missing, so I rip the shrink wrap off the Wii version I’ve had on a shelf for two or more years. It isn’t the same, and I’m not surprised. The cut scenes are endless. Getting started seems like it’ll take days. The mayor tells me I owe him 5,000G but can pay him whenever I want to. I wonder if he&#8217;s charging interest. I feel rudely misled when he insists I meet everyone in town before he&#8217;ll tell me anything useful. I talk to a few people who apologize for complaining about their misfortune in front of me and then return to city hall. “Have you met everyone in town yet?” the mayor asks again.</p>
<p>All townspeople I’m forced to interact with give me wrapped gifts: three fish, a scythe, a cookbook, a camera. They don’t seem to have much. The wizard is out of town and the priest on the hill has a graveyard but no congregation. There are stray cats and dogs without names. Everyone sighs heavily about how the harvest hasn&#8217;t been great lately. I don&#8217;t know what they expect me to do about it. I have fields to plow and cows to acquire and mushrooms to pick and I really don&#8217;t care much about fixing a bridge or bringing back local tourism. There&#8217;s a fairy buzzing around my head nagging me about going to see the Harvest Goddess who lives down some mine. I&#8217;m angry. The game I remember did not force me to engage with plot. A plot existed, sure, but there was no urgency. If I decided to stay on my farm planting turnips and cutting grass and feeding my livestock &#8220;magic potions&#8221; to make them reproduce, that was my business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was in college, we had a farm on campus, but we weren&#8217;t an A&amp;M school–just an accredited commune with no majors, grades, or exams. You could take a class that required you to sit vigil while the sheep gave birth in the spring and keep a journal about it. I never watched the sheep births, but I visited the cows a lot. I liked their smell. That isn&#8217;t entirely true. I knew objectively the smell was bad, but I couldn&#8217;t stop smelling it. Manure just happened and on hot days the smell would float down from the pasture to my house and I&#8217;d smell it while smoking a cigarette on the porch before bed. It reminded me of how I&#8217;d promised myself that if I went to school at all, it would be in a city.</p>
<p>The problem with cities is that people expect that you are waiting, dormant or asleep, whenever you&#8217;re not immediately interacting with them. It’s insulting. If you run into an acquaintance on the street, it often seems as if they&#8217;re in physical pain as they try to reconcile your presence in this place they never see you. It’s the reason I hate coffee shops. I don&#8217;t go out for coffee because it&#8217;s a near-guarantee I&#8217;ll be forced to small talk with someone. They will ask cursory questions about how I&#8217;ve been and try to make tentative plans when all I want to do is drown myself in iced tea. No one actually cares about the answers to these questions (What have you been up to lately? Will you bring me milk and a strawberry? Have you met the Harvest Goddess? Can you get my toolbox from the mayor?) but they ask them anyway to be polite. I have no use for politeness surrounding my caffeine intake.</p>
<p>I should admit that I work in a coffee shop. Maybe this adds to my distaste. No coffee is as good as the coffee I make for myself. I drink plenty of other coffee though, mostly to be polite. People always want to meet up where there are other people around, as if being social doesn&#8217;t count unless some third party sees you doing so. Most days, I don&#8217;t want to talk to anyone. Especially not people who wouldn&#8217;t just come find me in my house and sit next to me while I stare at a television, cursing about crops.</p>
<p>When I lived near cows, nobody ran into each other by accident. If you went into town, it was for a specific purpose. Beer, Chinese food, textbooks. But mostly, you ate ramen by yourself and wrote papers. I was excellent at both.</p>
<p>My college boyfriend gave me his old Game Cube because I am patently terrible at most video games. He wanted to play <em>Super Smash Brothers</em> whenever we were stoned in his dorm room and I just couldn&#8217;t hang. The learning curve on combo moves was too steep for me and button mashing is an inadequate coping mechanism. Whichever character I’d chosen would rocket off the map within minutes. The only games he had for the Game Cube that he was willing to part with were Paper Mario and Harvest Moon. I picked the one he liked the least.</p>
<p>The point of a virtual farm is the opposite of the point a virtual battle. In a virtual battle, same as in an actual battle, the point is winning. On a virtual farm, you are not competing against anyone. You are competing against the virtual earth and the virtual elements, most of which are deeply predictable and easily remedied. The virtual earth and elements cannot punch you in the throat or explode right next to you or incinerate you for not paying close enough attention. The virtual earth is the kindest, most patient opponent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We never had a system in my house growing up that wasn&#8217;t inherited from cousins who&#8217;d replaced it with a more current version. I remember standing in front of our living room TV with the <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun while the dog pointed and laughed at me. It was traumatic to be bad when all of my friends knew how to do this thing and used it to be social without actually being social. Going to someone else&#8217;s house to play video games was an invitation I dreaded because I was already socially embarrassing and my inability to kill bosses would only compound that.</p>
<p>The point of a virtual farm is that nobody wants to see it. It is yours and you never have to share. There is no boss to beat and no one to impress. No friends with better farms because your friends have never played this game, nor do they care that you do. The best thing about Harvest Moon is that it isn’t a team sport. I am terribly uncompetitive. In college, I was broke and a stoner and convinced I could do nothing properly besides read and annotate novels no one cared about anymore. I had no GPA, so I had no idea if “properly” was how I did anything, but I kept showing up to class on time and meeting with my advisors and they renewed my scholarship every year so my effort counted for something. I sat on my porch smoking a lot of nights, smelling the cows at the farm. My roommate Sophia was inside playing <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. Or. My roommate Cass was inside playing <em>Twisted Metal 2</em>. Or. My roommates Sophia and Cass were inside shit talking their way through a <em>Mario Kart</em> session. I never played with them not because I didn&#8217;t want to, but because I didn&#8217;t know how and knew I couldn’t learn. I went inside and sat on my bed and watered my potatoes and mowed my fields and fed my livestock. Little hearts floated up out of their heads. I went to sleep in the game to save my progress and then went to sleep in real life.</p>

<p>The point of a virtual farm is that there is no point. <em>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life </em>is the no-risk, all-reward <em>Oregon Trail</em>. You don&#8217;t have to worry about taking care of a family or braving disease in hopes of finding some future prosperity, but the pace is similar: plodding along, repeating tasks in the same small space for the same unremarkable results. There’s nothing riding on your efforts. No board of high scores. Not like this strange new version. Have I met the Harvest Goddess? Nope. Will I go looking for her? Not likely. I don’t want to play Harvest Moon unless it’s <em>A Wonderful Life</em>. My cow and sheep were named Spork and Foon, and I loved them. My seasons were modest but successful. There were no goals but maintaining this quiet victory of surviving and making it so other things could survive too. Not flourish, but survive. There&#8217;s a vast difference. Survival is all I need to feel like a winner.</p>
