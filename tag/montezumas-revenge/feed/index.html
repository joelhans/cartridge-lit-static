								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>skulls are rolling in each level a new pyramid coloured from purple to orange to green to red to black to pink bricks of pixels chains of fire if you looked at the pyramids from above and they opened one by one they would uncover entire labyrinths of dead ends traps and trapdoors skulls are rolling let the spiders swarm out let the snakes billow out</p>
<p>there’s nowhere to escape no chances left no forgiveness an aztec mosaic of pixels with concentric squares inside one pixel wide squares with pixels branching out from them dispersed sometimes forming spiral squiggles sometimes forming nothing like a colourful cellular automaton coloured from green to navy-blue to fuchsia to yellow to pink and red there’s nowhere to escape</p>
<p>fire on the walls paintings on the walls you’re climbing ropes descending ladders and i guess you’re unaware i’m watching you unaware of the mighty power i have over your fate there’s nowhere to escape skulls are rolling let the spiders swarm out you’ve got no chances fleeing through the pyramid’s chambers where there are spiders galore where serpents await you where toothless and toothed skulls are rolling towards you where chambers are laid with bricks and in places filled with lava where your only fate is death</p>
<p>an abyss there’s no way to get out don’t ask forgiveness don’t ask for help don’t ask chalchiuhtlicue she won’t help you don’t ask she won’t fill the abyss with water for you to swim up mosaics like a cellular automaton they move they devour the walls don’t ask forgiveness</p>
<p>keep running unaware that in all the walls are my eyes that i know your every move chains of fire montezuma’s revenge you’ll never escape but you keep running there’s no chance left bricks in the walls mosaics on the walls paintings and toothed skulls you keep running through chambers and chambers through levels and levels coloured from purple to orange to pink</p>
<p>don’t ask huitzilopochtli he won’t help you won’t elevate you on a cloud of hummingbirds shimmering with lightning and put you away safely ’cause for you there’s no safely ’cause for you in no chamber and in no level is safely ’cause for you there are only two-headed serpents jaguars spiders toothed skulls fire earthquakes straight from the heart of the mountains ’cause for you there are only the depths of lake texcoco ’cause for you there’s a fiery rain from the sky ’cause for you skulls are rolling rolling through orange and green and red ’cause for you there are labyrinths of dead ends traps and trapdoors there’s no mercy let the spiders swarm out let the snakes billow out there’s no you there’s no you in every brick my consciousness is hidden and there are no chances for you to find shelter in any of the hundred chambers you’ve got no chances lava is squelching in chambers of brick there are serpents spiders skulls are rolling</p>
<p>don’t ask mixcoatl he won’t help you won’t give you a ladder of stars swept with the milky way won’t make you a tube of fire that doesn’t burn so you could escape safely ’cause for you there’s no safely concentric squares coloured from yellow to fuchsia to green to red to pink a cellular automaton devouring the wall pixel by pixel devouring the symmetrical shapes there’s no safely every chamber every pixel hides a small bug and that’s how i hear your every breath and if you’re still alive it is only because i want you to fear longer escape longer suffer longer</p>
<p>but you keep running slowly starting to realise and you can’t find your way ’cause the labyrinths listen to me ’cause the chambers open only those doors that i tell them to open ’cause if i tell a door to disappear it disappears ’cause if i tell a chamber to become shrouded in darkness and rattled to the brim with a multitude of rolling skulls it happens and you can’t do anything don’t ask quetzalcoatl he won’t make you a bridge above the abyss a bridge of vines resembling green snakes overgrown with feathers</p>
<p>a mosaic climbing twisting forms the angularity of pixels the concentric squares pulsate lighting up some and putting out neighbouring pixels the end is near skulls are rolling through orange to green to red to pink through the hundred chambers and the hundred levels the cellular automaton devours you piece by piece and you start to get frightened you start to understand</p>
<p>if you looked at the pyramids from above and they opened burst fell into symmetrical pieces they would uncover like entrails entire labyrinths of dead ends traps trapdoors entire labyrinths of dead ends let the spiders swarm out you start to realise that you’ve been walking the inner chambers of my body that there’s no place here where i am not there’s no exit that would lead you out safely that skulls are rolling fire is burning lava is overflowing spiders are scurrying serpents are billowing and growing feathers fire is burning the hundred chambers and the hundred levels the cellular automaton devours</p>
<p>for you there’s no safely ’cause for you there are only jaguars and earthquakes and eagles gliding down from the sky and serpents and spiders and toothed skulls are rolling ’cause for you there are only the depths of a lake fire from the sky let the spiders swarm out for you skulls roll out for you snakes billow out a mosaic of black pixels concentric squares that pulsate lighting up then putting out everything black pixels are like a cellular automaton they move die devour the walls in every pixel are my eyes and ears in every such pixel is your destiny ’cause you’ve run into a trapdoor the black well of a tunnel the black well lined tightly with pixels that light up only for the billowing of snakes the swarming of spiders the rolling of skulls</p>
<p>no chances left no forgiveness</p>
