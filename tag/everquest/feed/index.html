<p> <strong>Blissviss understands the cleric is actually poison&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isn’t he. <br> It is not the Medicine that unravels her. She meditates in his pouch straps. <br> Notice they match her wicker throat. How he threads &amp; then destroys. <br> She runs years toward the Innoruuk inside her. Flag of blood darkens <br> spite, crave stony pile watch—craft of her people. She pretends <br> a wall &amp; destroys the dervish. Hikes another horrific green. <br> His hands twitch when touched by air. She understands. <br> The cure won’t ever hold the door open&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will he. <br> Trade from gold hammer to sword.&nbsp; Stamina 55. <br> Health is a lie. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p> <strong>Blissviss has a favorite meditation</strong><br> spot—sweet on the burnt bread, about three feet<br> above ground. The Nektulos Forest screams<br> its darkness, a devil saunters the grass in bare feet.<br> Her soft shoe leaves the ground. The sword across <br> her lap strikes with lightning, penetrates necromancy.<br> Solo on the field, no fear, three suns and no clouds,<br> part-time assassin. They say she was born from hate,<br> that her skin, blue, only glows during a kill.<br> She likes to watch the skeletons topple down the hill. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p> <strong>Blissviss travels home with her corpse</strong><br> at her heels. Make it brutal like an empty nest<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she sleeps in as a ghost. She follows her own body <br> as a ghost. A being <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; too scared to ask the big man for a res. The air, the color<br> like the inside of a throat and filled <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the sounds of her body bouncing <br> off rock, limbs plunking hard clumsy but damnit she is finally<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going home home home. </p>
