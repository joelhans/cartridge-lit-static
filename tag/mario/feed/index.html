								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Alyse Knorr is an assistant professor of English at Regis University and editor of Switchback Books. She is the author of the poetry collections  </em>Mega-City Redux<em> (Green Mountains Review 2017),  </em>Copper Mother<em> (Switchback Books 2016), and  </em>Annotated Glass<em> (Furniture Press Books 2013), as well as the non-fiction book  </em>Super Mario Bros. 3<em> (Boss Fight Books 2016) and the poetry chapbooks  </em>Epithalamia<em> (Horse Less Press 2015) and  </em>Alternates<em> (dancing girl press 2014). Her work has appeared in </em> Alaska Quarterly Review<em>, </em> Denver Quarterly<em>,  </em>Columbia Poetry Review<em>,  </em>The Greensboro Review<em>, and </em> ZYZZYVA<em>, among others. She received her MFA from George Mason University, where she co-founded Gazing Grain Press.</em></p>
<p><em>Below, Knorr talks with  </em>Cartridge Lit<em> contributor Elizabeth Deanna Morris Lakes about the Nintendo marketing machine, queer and female representation, the &#8220;Mona Lisa&#8221; of gaming, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><b>I saw you do a reading from your book, </b></em><b> </b><b>Super Mario Bros. 3 </b><em><b>(</b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b>)</b><b>, at AWP in LA in 2016. Before your reading, Gabe Durham, editor of Boss Fight Books, commented that while they knew there’d be a book on </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> eventually, they hadn’t planned to do one so soon after the </b><b>Super Mario Bros. 2</b><b> book, which had come out the season before. However! Your plan was so fully realized, he couldn’t say no to your pitch. Could you talk about your initial pitch for the book and how it changed (or didn’t!) as you wrote it? </b></em></p>
<p>One of my favorite things about Boss Fight Books is that each author takes their own unique approach to game writing and creative nonfiction. This meant I felt free to pitch a very hybrid blend of personal memoir alongside in-depth journalistic and scholarly research for my book.</p>
<p>A few things changed from pitch to final draft along the way. For instance, while I was hoping to talk to a current Nintendo employee, they’re a notoriously hush-hush company so this didn’t work out. However, I was incredibly lucky to be able to speak with <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Howard_Phillips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard “The Gamemaster” Phillips</a> and <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/12/how-we-played-with-power-secret-history-of-nintendo-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gail Tilden</a>, two important Nintendo employees at the time <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> (<em>SMB3</em>) came out. Their interviews were hugely helpful for providing insight into the <em>SMB3</em> era, and into what made this particular game so special.</p>
<p>As a whole, my research process gave me an even deeper enjoyment of and appreciation for <em>SMB3</em>. When I first started writing the book, I thought I already knew every single in-game secret and Easter Egg, but my research revealed way more—like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcTV9OQMgF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white mushroom houses</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l2Pnu9FnXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coin ships</a>, and a trick for <a href="http://protipoftheday.com/node/200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to determine</a> which direction a mushroom will veer toward after it pops out of a question mark block. I was also surprised to discover how pervasive <em>SMB3</em> has been in my life. In my pitch, I focused on my relationship with my father, who taught me to play <em>SMB3</em> before I knew how to read, and on how the game provided an outlet for my budding lesbian identity. As I wrote the book, however, I found even more connections to my own life, like the role <em>SMB3</em> played in my relationships with my little brother and with several friends.</p>
<p>Finally, as I interviewed a number of gaming experts and read dozens of reviews and analyses of <em>SMB3</em>, I became obsessed with a question that I hadn’t included in my initial pitch: how and why did this game achieve the cult status it did? Is <em>SMB3</em> truly “great,” or is all the hype just nostalgia? The answer I learned is: both. It <em>is</em> the “Mona Lisa” of gaming, as far as level design, flow state, cutting-edge features, replayability, and even music are concerned, but there are also many factors (see below) that make it a perfect object for nostalgia. And this combination is why it’s such a fondly remembered, cult-status game.</p>
<p><em><b>The question of nostalgia is a huge point in your book, as  </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> is a game that’s integrated itself into the collective consciousness of both gamers and non-gamers alike. Even I, who am notably terrible at this game, can hum the tunes and tell you all about the various enemy sprites more than I could any other game from this era. While I think it’s obvious why this game is so meaningful to those who played it rigorously (It’s innovative! Adorable! Bright!), could you talk more about how this game was able to create nostalgia for those less dedicated? Do you think there are any current games or franchises that might create this nostalgia for the youth today?</b></em></p>
<p>A perfect storm of influences makes <em>SMB3</em> so powerful as an object of nostalgia for an entire generation. First off, any beloved game or toy is going to produce intense feelings of nostalgia, because it’s associated with pleasant feelings from childhood. There’s a whole new Netflix series about this out now called <em>The Toys That Made Us</em>. But according to Phillips, <em>SMB3</em> is a particularly resonant object of nostalgia because it’s such a colorful, cartoonish, “cute” game—its joyful, goofy tone perfectly captures the innocence of youth in a really meaningful way.</p>
<p>We also remember <em>SMB3 </em>so well because it’s a masterpiece of game design. The tunes stick in your head because genius composer <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Koji_Kondo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koji Kondo</a> wrote them to do just that. You remember the enemies so well because they were engineered to be funny, adorable, and memorable—the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Koopalings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koopalings</a> are all named after rock musicians, for crying out loud! At the time of <em>SMB3</em>’s release, game developers were still a little spooked by the huge Atari Crash of 1983, so Nintendo was operating an intense quality control system. They simply weren’t putting out bad games.</p>
<p>Another huge nostalgia factor was <em>SMB3</em>’s marketing campaign, which was utterly massive. In the era of <em>SMB3</em>, Nintendo of America had recently hired a new head of marketing and significantly stepped up their strategies. The campaign for <em>SMB3</em> created an unprecedented level of hype. Eleven months after <em>SMB3</em>’s release, it was still the second highest-selling toy in the U.S., with the NES console itself in first place. The game was marketed like a Blockbuster movie, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU80R7jGanE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV commercials</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY7qEa7QJBs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV show</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSxdvRoa-1k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDonald’s Happy Meal toys</a>; and a ton of merchandise, memorabilia, toys, and clothes. This was also the heyday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Nintendo Power</em></a> magazine, the Nintendo-published magazine that served as a powerful advertising tool. <em>SMB3</em> was the first game to get its own dedicated issue <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZR5YB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy guide</a> from <em>Nintendo Power</em>, which made everyone hungry for the game itself to come out. And we can’t forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbqd2QMkuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Wizard</em></a>, a Fred Savage kids’ movie that was essentially, in the words of David Sheff, a 90-minute <em>SMB3</em> ad that audiences paid to view. What all this adds up to is that for many of us, our <em>SMB3</em> nostalgia is not only for the game itself, but also for the feeling of anticipation that led up to it.</p>
<p>Finally, the game’s timing made it essentially ubiquitous for American children. It’s easy to forget that in 1990, Nintendo was at the absolute peak of its reign over the video game industry, controlling 80% of the home console market. One in three American homes had a Nintendo console. So when Nintendo released a new game in this era, everyone noticed. And, according to Tilden, this was exactly Nintendo of America President <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Minoru_Arakawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minoru Arakawa’s</a> strategy: for everyone to be playing the game at the same time, talking about it on the playground, and spreading the hype. For this reason, even if you didn’t have an NES or have <em>SMB3</em>, you probably played it at a friend’s house or heard folks talking about it at school. And if not that, then you probably heard a commercial or caught a glimpse of the TV show or saw a kid wearing a T-shirt. Perfect storm.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine another game ever achieving this same exact combination of nostalgia triggers, but I suppose it could happen. In general, I think game and toy nostalgia for today’s youth is going to feel different from ours, because they’ve grown up with the internet where they have their own niches—there are far more playgrounds for them to talk on now.</p>
<p><em><b>It was so meaningful to me, as someone who’s dressed up as Link from the  </b></em><b>Zelda</b><em><b> series for Halloween at 12, 20, and 28, to read about your experiences of the game through a queer and female lens. I felt a deep sense of dread as I read about your performance at holidays, as you opened presents meant for who your relatives all thought you should be, not who you actually were (why can’t we just listen to our children?), though your own patient parents felt like a thrilling victory. But, and I apologize here for this bit of a tangent, while one could argue that  </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> is in many ways for anyone, it still has the princess as not only locked up and unattainable, but as part of a mysterious chase. Which is to say, it’s incredible that you found yourself in that game, but I feel like that discovery was partially out of your own wonderful imagination. Could you talk about how your imagination had to realign what you were given to fit your needs as a kid, without queer or even female representation there for you? </b></em></p>
<p>I’m always amazed at the creative ways that girls and queer people can imaginatively locate ourselves in male-dominated, heteronormative, and cisnormative narratives. It’s why subtext and camp are such significant elements of queer culture. And <em>SMB3</em> fits perfectly with this campiness—it’s full of performative elements like all the costumes, the theatre curtain that lifts up at the beginning of the game, the “off-stage” area at the end of every level, etc. <a href="https://kotaku.com/miyamoto-confirms-that-super-mario-bros-3-was-a-play-1729805751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miyamoto himself has confirmed</a> that all of <em>SMB3</em>’s characters are just actors in a play. This was a lot of fun for me to think about in terms of Butler’s theory of gender performativity, and the ways I have performed or failed to perform my assigned gender throughout my life. After all, when I was a girl, dresses felt like as much of a costume for me as Mario’s Tanooki suit.</p>
<p>So as a kid, I definitely had some of those negative experiences of feeling forced to perform a gender role that was constraining to me—including, like you mentioned, my big fake smile whenever I received a Barbie at Christmas. But what was important for me about <em>SMB3</em> was that it was a “safe” environment where I could perform my homosexuality by chasing/desiring the princess. I had this limitless free space in which to explore. And while I felt most connected to Mario, the princess-rescuing hero, I also related, subconsciously, to Bowser’s monstrosity and to the princess’s trapped status. So when me-as-Mario would defeat me-as-Bowser-the-monster, it was, on some level like I was overcoming my shame about being some kind of unnatural creature. And when me-as-Mario rescued me-as-trapped-princess, it was like I was overcoming the ways that society had “damseled” me and prescribed me gender roles that didn’t felt like they fit.</p>
<p>So I inhabited these self-generated, imaginary narratives in <em>SMB3</em>, with me as the hero, but I did this in other kinds of play, too—I was always Simba and not Nala, Robin Hood and not Maid Marian. And while I would have loved to have had Rey or the girl Ghostbusters growing up, I don’t regret that I didn’t, because it fine-tuned my imagination in ways I’m really grateful for. Until we get better gender representation in games, at least we have folks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-11-father-mods-donkey-kong-so-his-daughter-can-play-as-pauline-rescuing-mario" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this dude</a> who will hack into the code and make the changes themselves.</p>
<p><em><b>What was your favorite thing you learned in doing this deep dive of research for this book? Was there anything you learned that you couldn’t quite fit into the book?</b></em></p>
<p>My favorite discoveries all revolved around hardware, since this was the element I knew the least about as I began my research process and this was the info I found most difficult to dig up. What’s so special about <em>SMB3</em> is that it debuted late in the NES console’s life, so the developers really had to get creative and milk the console for all that it could do. This resulted in cutting-edge new features like screen-splitting (for the <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/super-mario-bros-3/screenshots/gameShotId,31691/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status bar</a> at the bottom of the screen), diagonal scrolling (for those maddening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6B_ARho00o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sky levels</a> in World 5), parallax scrolling (for the 3D effect that lets you drop behind the screen when you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owRYdqX4twM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crouch on a white block</a>), and animated tiles (for the moving question marks on blocks or the zooming card strips in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyiMXbKgeZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spade Panel mini-game</a>). Even Kondo got super creative with the hardware, using a certain sound channel in a really clever way to get it to produce more complex drum sounds. If you want to know what makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd78OMGLkVA&amp;list=PL6B16BD8C36B02A5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMB3’s soundtrack</a> so special, it’s all in the drums.</p>
<p>I found especially meaningful the fact that the game designers and software engineers saw the technical constraints of the era as a fun challenge rather than a frustrating limitation. In much the same way that a poet like me gets a kick out of the tight constraints of the sonnet form, <em>SMB3</em>’s team often found that working with such a tiny amount of memory (the Word Document I’m typing this in is five times the size of the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. file) often led to especially creative solutions. They truly loved the challenge and saw it as a way to show off their skills.</p>
<p>I did end up with a lot of extra material—my final draft probably incorporated about a third of all the fascinating research I found. This is fairly typical of my writing process—I like to write long and cut. I found way more scholarship on gender, sexuality, and gaming than I was able to use, and on the history of Mario as a character and Nintendo mascot. I also had to cut a playthrough of <em>SMB3</em> in which I taught my wife Kate how to play the game, which was really funny because she didn’t grow up with video games and enjoys teasing me about my obsession with Mario. I couldn’t put her playthrough anywhere in the book, but I loved doing it and have some very special memories from that experience.</p>
<p>Finally, I found a ton of super fun images, GIFs, trivia, and tips and tricks that just couldn’t fit anywhere into the book, so I put all of it up on <a href="https://supermariobrothers3.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Tumblr</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><b>I know, as someone who has read all your books, that you are also a poet! What else are you writing right now that we can look forward to? Do you plan to work on anything video game or pop culture related (like  </b></em><b>Mega City Redux)</b><em><b> soon? </b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for asking! I’m currently at work on two very different projects—the first is an opera libretto about the life of Christine de Pizan, the world’s first professional woman writer. After she was widowed at 25, Christine took up her pen in order to provide for her mother and three children. She became hotly engaged in debates with misogynist writers, writing long defenses of women that ultimately culminated in her 1405 allegory </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City of Ladies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which she dreamed up a world where women can live safe from sexism and gendered violence. In my book of poems </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mega-City Redux</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I imagine taking a roadtrip with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Xena Warrior Princess, and Dana Scully to search for the modern-day version of the city. What I’ve discovered after publishing that book, however, is that I’m still very much fascinated by Christine, and I want to share the story of her life and work with others. I’m writing the libretto by collaging together her original writings (in Middle French) and translating the resulting collage into modern French.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also working on a project called “Wolf Tours” that blends fiction and poetry to comment on eco-tourism, cultural appropriation, and depression. It’s a series of poems in the voice of a pack of wolves that runs a touring company. I’m having a lot of fun imagining what these wolves would sell in their gift shop, or how they would write a magazine ad for their company (poorly, it turns out).</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Jayme Russell is the author of two forthcoming chapbooks: </em>PINKification<em> (Dancing Girl Press, 2017) and </em>PINKpoems<em> (Adjunct Press, 2017). Her writing can also be found in </em>Black Warrior Review<em>, </em>Diagram<em>, </em>Fairy Tale Review<em>, and elsewhere. She received her M.A. in Poetry from Ohio University and her MFA in Poetry from The University of Notre Dame. She is a co-editor and writer at <a href="http://www.permadeathplease.com." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">permadeathplease.com</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Jayme Russell&#8217;s poem, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2015/06/03/mountain-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;Mountain Simulator,&#8221;</a> appeared in our  </em>Razzle Dazzle! <em>Temple Issue. Below, she talks with editor William Hoffacker about her simulated mountain, erasures, collage, </em>Duck Hunt<em>, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong>Your poem, </strong>“<strong>Mountain Simulator,</strong>”<strong> is based on the indie game <em>Mountain</em>. The opening sections of the poem (</strong>“<strong>GENRE</strong>”<strong> and </strong>“<strong>FEATURES</strong>”<strong>) are straight from the game’s web site. What else can you tell us about the origins of your piece? How did this game come into your life, and how did it affect you?</strong></p>
<p>My friend Jace started playing and was excited to show me. As soon as I saw how weird <em>Mountain</em> was, I had to make my own mountain. About a week into the gameplay, Jace and I agreed to write about the game separately, to see what would happen. We gave each other updates about our mountains. We planned to combine our drafts. Originally, I was even including our text messages into my writing. In the end, Jace didn’t use his piece, but I wanted to do something with mine. I removed the texts and made things a little more coherent.</p>
<p>I wrote whatever came to mind as I watched. <em>Mountain</em> is so calming because it moves slowly and there is white noise in the background. You don’t absolutely need to use your hands to play. I wrote while my mountain spun and spun, so my poem should show my stream of consciousness. The game affected me because it isn’t actually played; it is experienced. Watching is a kind of meditation.</p>
<p><strong>This poem is a mix of some lines in ALL CAPS, some not, and a few in boldface. At times it seems to take the perspective of a player or observer (</strong>“<strong>I zoom out and can see the whole glowing orb</strong>”<strong>), while at other points the point of view appears to be that of the mountain (</strong>“<strong>another plane just spiraled into me</strong>”<strong>) or the game (</strong>“<strong>I am a simulator</strong>”<strong>). How many speakers are in this poem? How did you organize your ideas about the game?</strong></p>
<p>To me, there are three voices in this poem, though they may all be the player. I’ve only read this to an audience once. I asked Jace and another friend of mine, Chris, to help me read, so that it was obvious that there were three voices. It really did not go well, because the audience consisted of mostly people interested in slam poetry, but I don’t regret it. Sometimes presenting new and unexpected material can be uncomfortable. When Chris read his own dense, long poem the audience was dead silent, as if they had to listen carefully to understand what this very intelligent poet was saying. The audience silence during my reading seemed to be saying this is really, really weird.</p>
<p>To be more specific, though, I think of the voice in plain text as the dominant voice, which is interrupted by the voice in caps. The speaker of the bold text often comments on the ideas in caps. Really, this is all me engaging with the game in different ways. I’m having a conversation with it. I often do this way in my writing. For example, I have responded to Bowie lyrics, <em>Doctor Who </em>dialogue, and Barbie commercials. Depending on my mood, I have different opinions and things to say about the media I interact with. Also, I loved the text within <em>Mountain</em>, as well as the “Saving.” I had to include it.</p>
<p><strong>Your bio says that you are </strong>“<strong>drawn to visual texts and works of erasure</strong>”<strong> and that you work with </strong>“<strong>fragments of text and collage.</strong>”<strong> When you create an erasure or a collage, what type of materials do you look for and how do you find them? How did your interest in these genres begin?</strong></p>
<p>A few years ago, I was reading a lot of erasure texts and poetry in which the same words kept popping up. I thought of them as fairy tale words: rose, sleep, forest, mirror, etc. I decided to work on erasures for an entire summer, focusing on building a fragmented narrative from the words that I found. I erased a variety of poems and organized my pages into different piles, according to fairy tale. The piles with the most content were about Snow White and Sleeping Beauty.</p>
<p>Because I like the texture of the Wite-Out on the page, I decided to use thick white paint to create a kind of mental fugue for Snow White as she loses consciousness. I think the idea really worked for the <a href="http://tinydonkey.fairytalereview.com/2015/09/snow-white-and-the-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opening</a> of the sequence. After later trying dark blue paint and failing, I thought I could bring in color with <a href="https://fairytalereview.com/2016/12/27/the-field/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collage</a> as a kind of border. I sifted through old books and magazines that I found mostly in library book sales, looking for photos that made me think of fairy tales. Then, I carefully placed my erased pages on each collage and took photos in many different ways. This led to some great surprises and made me think of each sequence of poems as continually moving and shifting. The poems are whole but the camera only allows the reader to see part of this whole by moving over and around the text.</p>
<p>I finished organizing my Snow White sequence into a book-length manuscript and my Sleeping Beauty sequence into a chapbook-sized manuscript. I have had some really wonderful editors open to putting my work online, like <em>Fairy Tale Review</em>, <em><a href="http://banangostreet.com/issue-11/jayme-russell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banango Street</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.matadorreview.com/jayme-russell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matador Review</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.radioactivemoat.com/jayme-russell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deluge</a></em>. However, several editors have been unable to or afraid to publish these erasures. They have had problems with my work because I refuse to cite where my materials are coming from, although I am completely complying with fair use standards. There is a negative stigma concerning erasures because some authors have made poor choices and have only erased the original author’s identity from the poems. Erasure itself has been misunderstood lately. There are some people who see erasure work as offensive to the original authors and others who believe that the original text should have a deep meaning or connection with the erased text. I see erasure as building a new text with existing materials.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond <em>Mountain</em>, describe your relationship with video games. What’s your history with them? Any favorite games? Do you play often?</strong></p>
<p>I am a Mario girl. I can glide through the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. I had the dual Mario/Duck Hunt cartridge. It’s the game that I have played the most in my lifetime. At one point as a kid I decided that I was going to beat <em>Duck Hunt</em>. Every level is the same and there is no saving involved. When I finished level 99 I thought I had won, but the level counter rolled over to the first level and the game continued. There weren’t any fireworks. I still find it disappointing.</p>
<p>My parents bought a Gameboy for me long after it had been originally released. Instead of <em>Tetris</em>, it came with <em>Kirby’s Dreamland</em>. So, I have never really liked <em>Tetris</em>. I became much more addicted to <em>Dr. Mario</em>. My other classic favorites are <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em>, and, of course, <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>.</p>
<p>Since having a son, I began playing more multi-player games. We have played so many hours of <em>Mario Kart</em>, as well as all of the PlayStation 2 Lego games: <em>Batman</em>,<em> Star Wars</em>,<em> Harry Potter</em>,<em> Indiana Jones</em>. My son is a teenager now, so he doesn’t really want to play with me anymore. He would rather just talk to me about the specific details of each version of <em>GTA</em>. He has a PS3, PS4, PSP, and a gaming computer. He likes to tell me how horrible Nintendo is. It’s a point of contention.</p>
<p><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p>I just wrote a strange sequence of poems from the POV of an amputated arm…</p>
<p>I’m interested in body horror and think it is always in the back of my mind when writing about the body. I have two chapbooks forthcoming in the next few months, entitled PINKification and PINKpoems. They are about the Barbie body and its influence on women over time. I started writing about Barbie when the new collection with different body sizes and shapes came out. In all the interviews that I watched, it was clear to me that Mattel only came out with this line of dolls because of consumer demand. It caused problems for the company. Not all of the Barbies fit in the clothes and the cars now. The bodies aren’t uniform. Mattel representatives still refuse to acknowledge that the product influences girls and their sense of body image. The new Barbies are an insincere step forward.</p>
<p>I am in the process of combining my two chapbook texts, adding another section that isn’t quite finished yet, and pulling everything together into a book-length whole. It’s funny that, much like “Mountain Simulator,” these poems have several different speakers, from commercial announcers to angry consumers to Barbie representatives to Barbie herself.</p>
<p><strong>What have you read and/or played recently that you’d like to recommend?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a poet with a day job as a children’s librarian, so I read a wide range of things. I have read the dark novel <a href="https://permadeathplease.com/2017/01/30/he-wanders-through-the-library-unable-to-decide-which-books-he-shall-take-with-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Murder Most Serene</em></a> and the new YA novel <em>Three Dark Crowns</em>, both of which have very different but interesting descriptions of poisonings. I’m on volume 12 of 19 in the manga series <em>Vampire Knight</em>. I have also read <a href="https://heavyfeatherreview.com/2017/01/02/puncture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inside the Walls of My Own House: The Complete Dark Shadows (of my Childhood), Book 2</em></a> and <a href="https://heavyfeatherreview.com/2017/03/15/algaravias/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Algaravias: Echo Chamber</em></a>. In terms of videogame-related books, I have to recommend <a href="http://thefanzine.com/burning-rubber-tearing-reality-a-review-of-august-smiths-the-mario-kart-64-poems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Mario Kart 64 Poems</em></a>.</p>
<p>The one game that I have had time to play lately is <em>Mario Run</em>. It’s strange, though, that I cannot listen to the music and play. It must be something about the sound being so close to me on my phone, rather than coming from a television. Nostalgia on a new device.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the beanstalk in winter</p>
<p>Here every surface earns its ice</p>
<p>Here there is a reward for your slowness</p>
<p>Here you will dig turnips from the frozen ground<br />
and cast them into the ocean</p>
<p>Here the whales are platforms to cross<br />
not like the real whales you will (nine years from now)<br />
read as glossy spots of wet ink</p>
<p>Here you will stand on a whale’s spout<br />
and be lifted</p>
<p>Here you can fling a potion and a door will sprout up</p>
<p>Here you can go on in to where it is evening<br />
and discover that you love it there</p>
<p>Here you will find elegance and lower body strength<br />
as the princess</p>
<p>Here as she leaps she lifts her skirts</p>
<p>Here you can hear her taffeta sweep the ice<br />
your taffeta</p>
<p>Here you learn where you want a door to grow<br />
and where a door will not be useful</p>
<p>Here you are only nine<br />
so you can create instructions on how to finish this level<br />
for the Rabbi who is still a family friend</p>
<p>Here you can slide on the ice<br />
with your sister</p>
<p>Here when you are hurt your body is shortened<br />
legs chopped from beneath you</p>
<p>Here if you hold the a-button you can linger in the air<br />
a canyon-jumper</p>
<p>Here the dogs behind you in the living room are both alive<br />
one of them licking a bald spot in the brown rug</p>
<p>Here every entrance feels like a secret entrance</p>
<p>Here the clouds are solid</p>
<p>Here behind you is the record player<br />
the piano with its green glass lamp and stuffed full bench</p>
<p>Here in this house on Hope Avenue there is a basement<br />
always on the verge of flooding</p>
<p>Here in the basement there is a seizure room<br />
with blankets on the floor for one of the dogs</p>
<p>Here the ice shines like glass</p>
<p>Here the cacti have frozen and have lost their needles</p>
<p>Here you will unearth a rocket ship<br />
once you learn where to dig</p>

<p>eternally at half-mast, an invisible question box whose vine shall never stretch to</p>
<p>that bonus stage in the sky. &amp; I keep waiting at the end of your favorite level for</p>
<p>a fake princess to tell me the truth: the life you thought you’d find is in another castle.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>after Donald Justice</em></p>
<p>There is a forward motion in old video games<br />
That keeps a character from going back.<br />
When you move, the camera pans from left<br />
To right but stops when you turn back.<br />
Some wall is following. The music keeps playing.</p>
<p>The same opponent appears over and over<br />
Trudging toward your fists. The surface is a knot<br />
That tightens on one end while it loosens<br />
On the other. The sky is full of ether.<br />
Tubes lead nowhere. The wall persists.</p>
<p>The world is divided into levels, so it stands<br />
To reason, life was worse in the beginning.<br />
As the dead pile up, the evil thins but in force<br />
Increases. The wall was built to keep it<br />
From circling back to the beginning.</p>
<p>The screen is very dusty, kid. Go back to work.<br />
One day the wall will be gone for good.<br />
Good and evil will act exactly the same,<br />
And all that we accomplished from dying and saving<br />
Will be erased as if we’d never been playing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I leap and the flag falls<br />
then the princess<br />
must be in the assigned building—</p>
<p>for god’s sake<br />
let’s not have a repeat of last time<br />
or I will tear this mother-<br />
fucking pixeled piece of shit DOWN</p>
<p>look I have<br />
as much patience as the next man<br />
but there are limits</p>
<p>when I move across a space<br />
I expect someone to save</p>
<p>a place for me for someone to care<br />
if I follow them<br />
from castle to castle</p>
<p>it’s not about<br />
reward<br />
but it might be<br />
about sliding down a pole<br />
and calculating that score</p>
<p>I thought<br />
your hair<br />
across the grid of a pillow’s weave<br />
was a code I could input for flying<br />
I thought the achievement<br />
we reached at the same goddamn time<br />
meant something more<br />
than just a level procured</p>
<p>if I’m the dragon I’m the one you made me</p>
<p>if I’m the plumber<br />
this is my wrench thrown<br />
against the soft peach of your skull</p>
