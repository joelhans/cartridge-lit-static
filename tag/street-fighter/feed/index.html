								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Congratulations, Computer!<br />
</strong><em>Street Fighter 2 (Ode to Chun-Li) </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Long before I could lace sneakers<br />
and bike without training wheels,<br />
I understood how to buy violence</p>
<p>like instinct: feed the arcade<br />
cabinet’s slot a silver Washington;<br />
punch the red button that signals</p>
<p>Start; select Dhalsim, Zangief, Ryu,<br />
usually Blanka the green beast<br />
from Brazil, though never Chun-Li.</p>
<p>The mallrats called her names<br />
I didn’t know, said she’s designed<br />
for girls to play and boys to ogle</p>
<p>or beat. With Blanka’s gnarled claws,<br />
I could K.O. Ken—the fair-skinned<br />
blonde boy who fought by the docks—</p>
<p>but Chun-Li’s Hundred Rending<br />
Kicks hauled my fevered monster<br />
to corner screen like a sandlot bully</p>
<p>who groped the wrong girl. If Chun-Li<br />
was built to beat on, why did she fight<br />
more relentless than her swollen male</p>
<p>counterparts? Didn’t my defeat assume<br />
her name and figure? Baby blue skirt,<br />
brocaded ox horns, sheer panty hose</p>
<p>hugging her most sinister weapon:<br />
sledgehammer legs bashing Blanka’s<br />
brain ‘til golden chicks fog his vision.</p>
<p>Congratulations, computer. <em>Perfect<br />
</em>still flashes after every bout against<br />
Chun-Li. Thank you for teaching me</p>
<p>to treat thighs with reverence, to never<br />
underestimate giggly girls in short skirts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations, Computer!<br />
</strong><em>Harvest Moon (Nintendo 64)</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s easier to land the hottest girl in town when you serve her<br />
</em><em>some of that special soup in the kitchen of your giant mansion. – Aaron Boulding, IGN </em></p>
<p>Once per lifetime,<br />
you may trade fish<br />
for the blessing<br />
of the Lake Goddess.<br />
Successfully hook the elusive<br />
blue trout, throw it back.<br />
The Goddess emerges,<br />
green-haired specter<br />
over water, and boosts<br />
your choice bachelorette’s<br />
affection fifty points.</p>
<p>Say Karen’s the reason<br />
you give gold<br />
to the bar. Next time<br />
you’re floating eye<br />
-balls deep in merlot,<br />
her heart will swell<br />
a shade brighter—banter<br />
perfumed in flattery<br />
as she refills your glass.<br />
You fight to keep face<br />
from smashing table.</p>
<p>If she remarks sour, if she’s<br />
not one big-bright-sunshine<br />
emoji, the system’s<br />
haywire. Bachelorettes<br />
with high affection<br />
should never speak ill<br />
of your presence. You’re the hero.<br />
Barring crackpot anomalies,<br />
gifting’s best for winning<br />
a woman’s bubblegum heart.</p>
<p>Most women love two things<br />
tops. Karen loves wine<br />
and fish: ten points each.<br />
With fresh caught<br />
fish writhing in hands,<br />
hoof it to her house<br />
every evening unannounced<br />
for one year.<br />
If she’s not home,<br />
sprint to the bar before close.</p>
<p>Nudge Karen’s noggin with fish<br />
to gift her on the clock.<br />
Her awe and surprise<br />
won’t diminish, no matter<br />
how often you do this.<br />
If she sighs or rolls eyes<br />
after your thousandth fish,<br />
the game’s glitched. Women<br />
never grow sick of gifts,<br />
least of all yours. Assuming</p>
<p>the system works, her heart<br />
will turn pink by summer. See pink<br />
valentine flash when she speaks?<br />
Call the lumber<br />
-jack, order King-Size Bed,<br />
wait one week,<br />
and remember to deliver<br />
fish—by the satchel<br />
if you can. Once the bed’s installed,<br />
scour General Store<br />
for Blue Feather. This is classified</p>
<p>under Tools, like Axe, Hammer,<br />
and Watering Can.<br />
Next time you see Karen,<br />
wield the Feather<br />
to propose, and don’t forget<br />
to give her fish!<br />
If you own the King-Size Bed<br />
and her heart’s pink,<br />
she’s 100% guaranteed<br />
to say yes. If she rejects you,</p>
<p>reset system. Call mother.<br />
Increase fish-gifting<br />
to ten satchels daily.<br />
She’ll only say yes<br />
after receiving enough fish.<br />
If the game functions<br />
properly, you’ll kiss Karen<br />
outside the white-steeple<br />
church on Sunday.<br />
Once you shack, do not slack.<br />
For healthy marriage<br />
and children, bring home</p>
<p>fish: as many and often<br />
as foreseeable. You’re the provider.<br />
This means fishing away<br />
hours in the most sinister weather.<br />
This means packing home<br />
to the gills with fish for famine<br />
or flood. Your domestic<br />
success rests on a fridge<br />
overflowing with fish,<br />
cupboards choking in fish,</p>
<p>fish bleeding out the windows,<br />
oozing from front door<br />
to flowerbed for neighbors<br />
to marvel. Do not tire<br />
‘til wedding bed and baby’s crib<br />
are buried in fish.<br />
The Familial Dream trophy<br />
will remain unattained<br />
‘til you, wife, and child drown<br />
beneath your catch.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>When Your Madden Running Back Retires</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You curse him,<br />
shrug, note</p>
<p>his speed dropping<br />
two points a season</p>
<p>for the last<br />
three seasons,</p>
<p>relive the fumble<br />
in the January snow,</p>
<p>relive the shoulder injury<br />
that kept you from going</p>
<p>undefeated. You never needed<br />
him. But you wanted</p>
<p>one more 1,000 yard year,<br />
one more run</p>
<p>with the gem<br />
you discovered in the muck</p>
<p>of a fifth round video game draft.<br />
You want him to last</p>
<p>a little longer because<br />
if his knees have finally gone,</p>
<p>you have to think about your knees<br />
and the songs they sing</p>
<p>when you trade one can for another<br />
in the kitchen. He’s gone</p>
<p>away to spend more time with his family.<br />
When was the last time you called your family?</p>
<p>You do remember that it was family<br />
that put the controller in your hand</p>
<p>in the first place, don’t you?<br />
The envy only second sons can know</p>
<p>pushed you to push buttons faster,<br />
to push “mute” so mom didn’t find</p>
<p>your hands pawing a wet<br />
controller in the dead of the night.</p>
<p>Your brother stopped beating you<br />
years ago. Your mom’s just happy</p>
<p>you’re not dead and you’re not asking<br />
for money that much these days.</p>
<p>Your running back moved on.<br />
Your video game grew up.</p>
<p>What happened to you? Really,<br />
I’m asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>June 10, 1992</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent the hours punishing my brother<br />
with midair backbreakers and eating cheeseburgers.<br />
If I say it was the best day of my life,<br />
some of you will understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do They Play Like Ryu or Guile?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When life was as simple as a button<br />
combination and a sticky cabinet,</p>
<p>this question told us all we needed to know.<br />
It was “Ford or Chevy?” It was</p>
<p>“Batman or Superman?”<br />
Does this character move</p>
<p>in arcs and circles, nothing but<br />
tornadoes, cyclones,</p>
<p>and fireballs? Or are we charging<br />
in a straight line like Hector</p>
<p>and his phalanxes? Back-Forward.<br />
Up-Down. Remember</p>
<p>when these were the only options<br />
the world gave us. Remember</p>
<p>when they felt like all the choices<br />
we’d ever need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wings of Liberty</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We opened beers with our teeth<br />
because we were men, and men didn’t carry<br />
bottle openers on Spring Break.<br />
At the pier, we decided on oral sex</p>
<p>being a reciprocal thing because, well,<br />
manhood was about obligations.<br />
We spent days collecting names<br />
and numbers and faces, but at night</p>
<p>they never matched. We laid our IDs<br />
on the counters with pride and tried not to<br />
giggle into our rum because men<br />
didn’t giggle. We were old enough</p>
<p>to know that, old enough to drink and hold<br />
a dollar between a woman’s breasts<br />
in a strip club we could never find again.<br />
But men were explorers, and we found</p>
<p>our muse when she fell off the stage<br />
during “Air Force Ones.” She laughed;<br />
we laughed, but I wasn’t sure<br />
who was laughing at who</p>
<p>but I didn’t ask because men<br />
weren’t supposed to ask<br />
too many questions<br />
in front of a naked woman.</p>
<p>She whispered promises in my ear,<br />
but before I reached for my wallet<br />
the Terran theme from <em>Starcraft</em><br />
reached my ears. I waited to see</p>
<p>if my RTS-loving stripper fantasy<br />
was going to come true, but<br />
it didn’t. The music wasn’t for the stage.<br />
It was the DJ playing</p>
<p>the game in the back corner.<br />
I left my muse to go talk to a guy<br />
about siege tank defense and fucking<br />
Zerg rushes. He said he was just passing</p>
<p>the time, and we traded strategies<br />
while we watched space marines<br />
put flamethrowers to alien parasites<br />
instead of watching live</p>
<p>nude girls. The DJ joked about watching<br />
the wrong thing. I told him naked girls<br />
weren’t new to me. I lied. But I was honest<br />
about the Zerg. Without tanks, they were tough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>After I Heard Another White Woman at the Bar Talking About Michael Vick and the Death Penalty</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike, I wanted to hit her<br />
with a history lesson<br />
about black men</p>
<p>never getting what they deserve<br />
from the law.<br />
But she’ll go to OJ,</p>
<p>I’ll go to Emmett Till,<br />
She’ll say I can’t think<br />
of what it’s like to lose</p>
<p>a pet and I’ll say<br />
she can’t understand because she doesn’t<br />
have a black dick between her legs</p>
<p>and America around her neck<br />
and she’ll say it’s not the same<br />
and that’s the only thing we’ll agree on</p>
<p>before her boyfriend shows up<br />
with a shot and a shrug for everyone.<br />
Thing is, Mike, I wanted to hit you, too,</p>
<p>years before the first shovel<br />
touched your backyard<br />
in Virginia. But it wasn’t because of the rape</p>
<p>stands and electrocutions; it was because you ran<br />
circles around my linebackers on <em>Madden 2004</em>.<br />
You took away my safety</p>
<p>blitzes and zone coverages.<br />
If you finished the game, I was finished,<br />
so I hit you every play.</p>
<p>I hit you on run plays.<br />
I hit you on pass plays.<br />
I grinned every time</p>
<p>your virtual body broke<br />
and my opponents turned into Priam<br />
weeping over Hector’s corpse</p>
<p>or some other Trojan father whose son caught<br />
a spear with his throat.<br />
They didn’t want to go on without you</p>
<p>as their leader. The contest wasn’t worth<br />
the dollars on the coffee table<br />
if you weren’t standing.</p>
<p>They would swear they learned<br />
to never gamble their future<br />
on the shoulders of one man again.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the world care<br />
about a black body so much,<br />
even if I wanted to break it.</p>
