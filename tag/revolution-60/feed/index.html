								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I have never contacted The Commander.</em><br />
<em>I have never interacted with The Commander.</em></p>
<p><em>I have never heard of the Commander</em><br />
<em>before his repeated threats of violence against me.</em></p>
<p>“I am ParkourDude91.”<br />
&#8220;If you think I&#8217;m the type of person to let anything go, you don&#8217;t know me.”</p>
<p><em>I have to be honest.</em><br />
“. . . the only guns I&#8217;ve ever had in videos were all Airsoft replicas.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not sure what needs to happen here.</em><br />
“I am a 23 year old unemployed disabled veteran, alone in the world with no career<br />
skills, no higher education, no girlfriend, totally isolated . . .”</p>
<p>“I have dignity.”<br />
“It is known as Operation Wupocalypse.”</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m entertainment. I&#8217;m not a person. I&#8217;m a sport.</em><br />
<em>. . . but the truth is, you&#8217;re frankly not a very smart enemy to have.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s my hope.</em><br />
<em>It’s my hope.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Adapted from statements made about and by Gamergate supporter Jace Connors (since revealed to be self-styled comedian Jan Rankowski) and Gamergate target Brianna Wu, who helped create the game pictured above.</em></p>
