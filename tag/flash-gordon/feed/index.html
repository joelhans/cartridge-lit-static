								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Self Portrait as Flash Gordon<br />
[Atari 2600 Video Game Adaptation]</strong></p>
<p>There is no Flash Gordon, only this space<br />
ship swiveling back and forth in an arena<br />
of stars that are not stars but pixels flickering,<br />
an illusion of movement. There is no enemy<br />
swarm that strikes with violent shimmer,<br />
only the soul which is really that confusion<br />
a boy feels when he tries to pay attention<br />
to three things at once. Above: an expedition<br />
to rescue astronauts, who are not men<br />
but lights outlining a man’s body<br />
as a boy imagines it to be—blocky,<br />
upright, arms windmilling to maintain<br />
balance in the abyss. Below: the map,<br />
contorted and tangled, no wind rose,<br />
no landmark. Outside: your father<br />
who is your father but also a wraith,<br />
your father who is not your father<br />
but a series of monstrous noises in the ether.<br />
There is a force field. There is a joystick.<br />
There is no Flash Gordon, only a boy<br />
and a video game that is not a video game<br />
but that is lion heart and lily liver,<br />
that is the future of the universe, that is<br />
what’s left inside a boy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Self Portrait as Flash Gordon</strong><br />
<strong> [Commodore 64 Video Game Adaptation]</strong></p>
<p>1.<br />
Skeletons, you spear me through<br />
the chest, hollow spot where once<br />
a target pulsed. Ape-men, you descend<br />
from trees, rend limb from shoulder<br />
blade from ankle bone. The spiders<br />
know I am the electron, the lightning<br />
spirit, power up and pixel heart.<br />
The jungle slides by screen by screen—<br />
yawning chasm, dinosaur breath.<br />
Bees, you swarm my body,<br />
as if agony could be electricity<br />
could be flesh. You cannot destroy<br />
what I do not have.</p>
<p>2.<br />
I am callouses on a man’s knuckles,<br />
blockbuster and right cross. I am<br />
heartshine. I am thumb cramp. I am a fistful<br />
of sand, a dash of gravel to close<br />
a man’s eyes. I am knife hand, praying<br />
mantis, crescent moon kick in a fight<br />
that moves too quick for blood, too dirty<br />
for choreography. I am groin punch.<br />
I am groin punch.<br />
I am groin punch.</p>
<p>3.<br />
There is no such thing as speed,<br />
only moving landscapes, a geography<br />
for empty space. There is no such thing<br />
as geography, only acceleration, a motorcycle<br />
chase in 16 colors across a checkerboard.<br />
I am wildfire and gasoline. I am desire<br />
fizzing in the bottle, sun bursting for yolk.<br />
The explosions know there are no explosions,<br />
only blasts of color against the pale blue,<br />
a voice at the vanishing point: Velocity is just<br />
<em>a trick of light, a man just a body in motion</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Self Portrait as Flash Gordon</strong><br />
<strong>[Bally Pinball Squawk &amp; Talk Isolation]</strong></p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br />
This machine has a reputation—all screech<br />
and catcall, lights and sound bites to spur<br />
you to nudge and bangback. Everything<br />
is drawn to the drain eventually.</p>
<p><em>Emperor Ming Awaits</em><br />
You can’t choose your own enemies.<br />
Others will make that decision<br />
for you. Give up on karate chops<br />
and fancy kicks, on rooster feathers,<br />
on eagle claws. Shoot your steel<br />
ball into the fray, realize your desire<br />
for tattoos—lightning bolt, rocketship<br />
vs. mystery planet, a woman’s name.</p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br />
Not your name. A strobe of light.<br />
Your name. A lifespan.</p>
<p><em>Ignite Death Rays, Fifteen Seconds</em><br />
Your mother predicted you would grow<br />
up to be an astronaut, your father anything<br />
but an astronaut. The lights strobe quick<br />
like the quasar’s flicker, the eyeball shimmer.<br />
This machine speaks with the android fuzz,<br />
the buzz and crackle insisting you<br />
give up on moonwalks, on swimming<br />
in asteroid fields. Give up on sexy space<br />
suits and ever flying with a jet pack.</p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br />
Over ramp and cockcrow. Through comet<br />
and sonic boom. In the thick of slingshot<br />
and kicker. Straight past your flippers.</p>
<p><em>Ignite Death Rays, Fifteen Seconds</em><br />
The ball spits out of the kickout hole,<br />
ricochets past bumper pop and target<br />
drop—there are no death rays,<br />
only reprieve from true peril. Give up<br />
to invisible knuckles, to middle school<br />
hallways, to number two pencils<br />
gripped like shivs. On the backglass,<br />
Flash Gordon is dashing with a golden<br />
machete. Emperor Ming’s bodyless head<br />
fixes you with a sinister glare.</p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br />
Laser. Siren. Animal sounds.<br />
These are your new name.</p>
<p><em>Try Again, Earthling</em><br />
Try again, half-pint—the aliens are<br />
disguised as girls wearing Aqua Net<br />
and black vinyl. Try again, monkey<br />
boy or be defeated with headlock<br />
and titty twister. This machine will go<br />
silent one day so try again, junior—<br />
until the lights go out, until you slam<br />
tilt all the machines, until there is<br />
no such thing as a high score on earth.</p>
