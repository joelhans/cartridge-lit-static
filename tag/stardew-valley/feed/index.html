								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At dusk they moved through a landscape littered
with megafauna skeletons. Sand polished the bones and sifted into every crevice
on their bodies—between eyebrow hairs, into ear whorls, within clothing
creases. Huge jaws half-sunk in sand snapped at random, mandibles interlaced on
the squeak of something living, though neither of them saw anything move over
the tall dunes except tarantula-sized crickets which fell into holes at their
approach. Clumps of grass and scrubby bushes waited for the rains to bloom.</p>



<p>When they left the oasis that morning, others
walked alongside them, canteens sloshing against their legs, clear voices
singing harmonies. As the hours passed, the footprints faded. Most travelers
circumnavigated the dunes. He argued that traveling the mountain pass would add
weeks to their journey, and he wanted to cross the river to the valley town
before the river swelled with spring rain. With reluctance, they agreed. After
all, they told themself, getting a choice spot at the craft market would increase
sales of the hand-spun yarn and whittled dolls they carried. When he knew he
was going to get his way, he leaned in, held their arm, told them that in the
desert&#8217;s largest ribcage he would transform the cave jewel into the most
powerful sword in the realm. They wanted to believe him, but they were used to
the glass castles of his stories. </p>



<p>They pressed onward, toward the highest dune.
Wind formed ripples on the ridges which they destroyed with every step. When
they miscalculated trajectories of least resistance, the west-fading sand
scalded their palms. Tiny black beetles, barely larger than the sand
themselves, flailed in the avalanches created when they rested. They imagined
themself like the beetles trying to skate through the unforeseen. He kept turning
back to look at them. They tried to breathe against convulsing lungs, gave the
thumbs-up sign, and drank some water, hoping that if they pretended everything
was okay, it would be. Sand stuck in the dry cracks at the corners of their
lips. </p>



<p>They climbed the flanks of the Star Dune and
stood at its peak. On high, they noted landmarks on the map. The horizon hinted
at the valley. Below them, vertebrae the size of tires rested in a line. Dark
shapes floated across the sky, mirrored over the earth. In the distance,
thunder rumbled, and the breeze turned violent. They belly-crawled to avoid
lightning. When the gap between rumbles and flashes quickened, they curled up
on their packs. </p>



<p>Together they sheltered in the ribcage, the one
they meant to find, each rib big around as a cathedral column and casting
unearthly shadows. They sat with their backs against the largest rib and
covered their heads with fabric until the sand died down. He grinned and took
the prismatic shard from his pack. They loved his grin. Holding it, he walked
into the center of the ribcage, where it shape-shifted into an enormous purple
sword. In his excitement, he swung it, spinning and feinting, deep in battle
with an imaginary foe. They hugged their chin to their knees and watched. </p>



<p>As he spun, he mistimed and smashed the sword
into a rib. It stuck. They took turns pushing and pulling with combined weight.
No luck. Long after night fell, they hung their tentcloth from the blade, tying
the cloth edges to the other ribs. In sleep, they faced each other, their
foreheads, knees, and feet touching, packs under their heads. Sandy breeze
weighed down the cloth they wrapped around themselves. </p>



<p>All night they dreamed of escape from the belly of a cyclopean beast. He was there, too, his impish eyes above the edge of his scarf, mashing his feet into the muck as though stomping grapes. Their feet stuck in a churning mass of half-masticated flesh and meteoric stoats. Acidic moisture condensed on the walls of skin. When they tried to climb out, they gained purchase only to slip and crash. In dreamtime they melted into skeletons still trapped.</p>



<p>When the two of them woke, it was to vulture screeches and the sound of tiny bones clinking through a grate. In the night the towers migrated. Gathering dew from the tentcloth, they poured it into a bottle. In the light, the sword looked smaller than before. Onward they trekked, toward the town on the other side of the desert. They made a pact to not look back at the sword. On the next rise, he broke it. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One
day your daughter stops growing up. You notice right away. Her fingernails are
the same exact length that they were yesterday. You count her eyelashes, you
count the freckles on her cheeks, you count her teeth. All the same. She is two
years old.</p>



<p>When you were pregnant, other mothers would tell you that the baby stage was the best. You and your child, raw together in a bright, new world. They told you to savor those moments, that you’d miss them once they’d passed. But even after she was born, you couldn’t wait for your baby to grow up. You ached for the day when she’d be old enough to speak. Old enough for you to teach her things. Like how to catch a Woodskip in the secret woods, or how to pan gold from the lakes, or how to make friends with the Krobus in the tunnels beneath the cemetery. </p>



<p>You’d spent your life tilling fields, fending off the encroaching weeds and fallen logs, looking for ways to grow your tomatoes fatter, your grape vines vinier. You’d raised buildings. Incubated eggs in beds of hay. You’d taken your sword and pickaxe into the caves, found the end of every secret passageway. All you knew was a life of ambition and forward movement.</p>



<p>On the day your daughter stops growing up, she spends an hour staring at a beam of light traveling across the floor. You watch her from the kitchen and try to make a mental list of every word she knows. The average two-year-old can speak about seventy words. Does your daughter know more than that? Less? Are there words you don’t know to count? Maybe ones she’s spoken only to herself, alone at night in her bed.</p>



<p>You decide not to worry yet. Maybe this is just a phase she is going through. Maybe all children stop growing up at some point, and then start up again. Like a plant hibernating in the cold.</p>



<p>Summer moves forward. Your daughter dashes through the house like a bird caught in a gale. Every morning you count her freckles, measure the length of her hair. One night, after her bath, you trim one of your daughter’s thumb nails with a pair of scissors. You want to prove that your daughter is still capable of change, or capable of being changed. You trim the nail so short that you accidentally nick the skin. As your daughter wails, you dab at the blood with a tissue. You kiss the top of her head and apologize until she’s lulled to sleep and you can tiptoe to your own bed. The next morning, the first thing you do is go to your daughter to check the cut. But it has healed. Or, more accurately, it has completely disappeared. The trimmed nail is exactly the same length as it had been the morning before. You touch the spot on her skin where you’d made her bleed. She doesn’t flinch at all.</p>



<p>Autumn
comes. Your daughter falls asleep in her tiny, four-post bed, like a sea maiden
floating out to sea. Spiders flee indoors to build cobwebs in corners. Leaves
change colors from the inside out. Your house fills with pumpkins big and small,
and your daughter likes to stack the smallest into tall, teetering towers. All
day, she wanders around the house in nothing but a diaper, completely
unashamed. Unaware of the difference between being naked and being clothed.</p>



<p>Later,
raking leaves around the chicken coop, you think of a time when you were
fifteen and drunk for the first time at a party. Your ride had left without you,
and you had to call your mother to pick you up. Sitting in the front seat of
her car, you felt exposed and embarrassed in your tank top, your mother’s eyes
on the lacy bra visible through the fabric. You’d bought the bra with your own
money at the mall last Saturday, had been hiding it under your bed, afraid of
what your mother would think if she found it while putting away the wash. </p>



<p>Halfway
home, you puked into the backseat. <em>Ugh,
I’m sorry, mom</em>, you said. <em>I’ll clean
it up. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. </em>The worst part was your mother’s silence. She
didn’t speak until you were home and she was tucking you into bed. She hadn’t
tucked you in for years. Your vision spun, and all you could do was look up at
her as she placed your arms under the covers and propped your head up with
pillows. As she turned off the lights, she paused in the doorway and sighed. “I
wish I still had my baby,” she said, and closed the door behind her.</p>



<p>You
understood in that moment that you were no longer the daughter your mother
wanted, had in fact replaced her. Your mother had wanted a child, but she
didn’t want this adult you were becoming. Every day you grew farther away from
the fantasy she’d had of you. This thought made you sad for yourself but also
sad for your mother.</p>



<p>When you learned you were pregnant, you swore to never mourn the versions of herself your daughter left behind. You wouldn’t mourn the sound of her laughing alone in her crib in the early morning. You wouldn’t mourn her letters to Santa Claus, signed in awkward cursive. When your daughter got her first tattoo, you wouldn’t mourn the skin she covered up. You wouldn’t just love these new versions of your daughter, you’d welcome and like them.</p>



<p>But
now you find yourself mourning all of these future versions of your daughter
you will never meet. Your mother had wished for a forever-baby, and now her
wish is your curse. </p>



<p>Fall
becomes winter. Every day for the past six months, your child has woken up as
the same child. On the morning of the first snow, you bring handfuls of white
snow into the house and your daughter eats it. Stuffs her mouth full, then
cries when it melts and dribbles down her chin.</p>



<p>You read in a child development book that children don’t start growing kneecaps until age three. That toddlers are ambidextrous. That two-year olds don’t understand yet that their mind is separate from other people’s. </p>



<p>You
understand now that this is how it will always be. This isn’t a phase. You will
grow old, and your baby will continue to be your baby. Continue to stack pumpkins
like blocks, continue to take handfuls of snow in her fists and expect it to
stay snow forever. Just as you can count on the Krobus to always be in the
sewers, and the dwarf to always be in the caves, and the wizard to always be in
his tower. You hope those other mothers were right. You hope the baby stage
will be the best.</p>



<p>You
wipe away the melted snow dripping down your daughter’s neck with the end of
your sleeve. Then you take her hand. You notice that her fist fits perfectly
inside your own, like a nut inside a shell. </p>



<p>“Want
to see more snow?” you ask your daughter.</p>



<p>“Snow,”
she says.

Neither of you are
wearing shoes or jackets, but you lead her outside onto the front porch anyway.
The warmth of the house still sticks to your skin and your clothes, and it will
be a minute before you feel the cold. Your daughter reaches out, waiting for
the snow to find her open palm, and you do the same.

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Melissa Goodrich grew up in a dome on a hill in Minnesota and now calls the southwest home. She is the author of  </em>Daughters of Monsters <em>(Jellyfish Highway Press) and is at work on a collaborative collection of magical school stories. Find more at <a href="http://melissa-goodrich.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">melissa-goodrich.com</a> or  <a href="http://twitter.com/good_rib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@good_rib</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Her poem, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/stardew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Stardew,&#8221;</a> appeared in our  </em>Next Gen <em>Temple Issue</em><em>. Below, she talks with editor William Hoffacker about escapism, reincarnation, daughters, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What is it about  </strong></em><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> <em><strong>that made you choose it as a subject for your writing? What’s special about this game that lends it well to poetry?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’ve played close to 300 hours of Stardew, and it’s because it makes me feel peaceful, cheerful, satisfied. It’s like deeply breathing. There is something serene about the soundscape, the way it feels when a day begins with rain, or you crack open a geode, or wrestle with a difficult fish. The game’s premise is escapism—in the opening sequence you see yourself at a gray cubicle amongst hundreds of grey cubicles, and you open a letter from your grandfather—and he’s willed you his Stardew farm. The game lends itself toward that fantasy of abandoning your old corporate-driven life to tend to something. To build a life upwards with the tools in your sack. I guess poems are that way too—poems are structures you build with your hands. Poems need weeding, need their geodes cracked. Poems need seasons, and magic, and rain.</p>
<p><em><strong>The poem’s speaker describes the things she wishes to do but never does, the things she does instead, things she loves, things she hopes for, things she fears, etc. The game has a player and a player-character, while the poem has an author and a speaker. How much of a divide do you perceive between the two, in both cases? When you wrote the poem, did you imagine the speaker’s desires or transcribe your own (or some of both)? When you play the game, do you act according to what you think the protagonist would do, or is the character merely your avatar in the virtual world (or some of both)?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a great question. I love absorbing myself into the world, and letting the world absorb back into mine. I will refer (in real life) to my Stardew kids, or my escaped goats. I’ve made lists of the townspeople’s birthdays, and their favorite gifts. I’ve wondered, “Where is Leah all day? I can’t find her anywhere in the forests.” And I will feel real-me dissolve when I shear the sheep or jump down a hole in the Skull Caverns. I think there’s a mutual joy in poetry and in gaming to allow that boundary of ‘who you are’ to muddle. You are neither the speaker nor the author, and you’re both. The same thing happens as a reader—it feels like your world the whole time you’re in it, and even after you’ve left.</p>
<p><em><strong>One thing that surprised me about your poem is how the speaker’s motherhood appears only near the end, and then questions and images surrounding the daughter dominate the final two stanzas. Why did you decide that the poem should take this new turn, and how did you choose the right moment to make it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Daughters are extensions, right? So are sons, but I’m a daughter—I feel the extension of being a daughter. All of my Stardew children are daughters. I didn’t choose this. They arrived in the night. Stardew-me didn’t once swell with pregnancy, but here they were: tiny swaddled girls. I’m not sure if real-me can mother, so I’m not sure Stardew-me can either. I’ve never seen my Stardew children leave the crib. I get antsy and start a new game. It’s somehow a relief to go back to the simple cabin. One bed. One chair. A single window. A pack of parsnips. A fireplace I can light with a touch.</p>
<p>But back to extensions—there is this natural progression to extend beyond one’s life. And I felt kind of bad for my Stardew kids. They wouldn’t get the pleasure of building-from-the-ground-up. I explored the whole world already, I moved every obstacle. They wouldn’t even be strapped for cash. I felt a little like I’d robbed them of something, these pixel-kids of mine. It’s a turn in the poem because it’s a turn in my head. The world is bigger than the ‘I.’ And suddenly the ‘I’ wants to live through the extension, the daughter. And the ‘I’ can’t sense a world in which that daughter doesn’t ‘walk through her.’ It’s something I think about regarding real daughters. It’s something I think about when I’ve sunk 300 hours into a video game.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your book, </strong></em><strong>Daughters of Monsters</strong><em><strong>, is a collection of short stories, mostly of a fabulist nature, guided by a lyrical voice. If you had to adapt one of those stories into a video game, which one would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></em></p>
<p>Oooh, that’s a tough one. I think a strong contender would be “Super,” a story where a character dies repeatedly and reincarnates into different objects. I think that could make for an interesting indie game. The goal to die instead of to live. Making it tough to die. Coming back as a cabbage.  Coming back as a cigarette. A zipper. An egg. It would be weird like <em>Undertale</em>, and maybe a little sad.</p>
<p><em><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m wrapping up a collaborative collection of <a href="http://passagesnorth.com/2016/10/the-classroom-beneath-our-classroom-by-melissa-goodrich-and-dana-diehl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magical</a> <a href="http://theindianolareview.com/the-floating-away-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school</a> <a href="http://www.theadroitjournal.org/issue-twenty-one-dana-diehl-melissa-goodrich-the-adroit-journal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a> with the phenomenal Dana Diehl. Seriously, she’s like my favorite living writer. Working with her on this project is so liberating and joy-filled. I adore the stories we make together, as we build on one another’s strengths and instincts and obsessions with being in school. I’m not sure what comes after that.</p>
<p><em><strong>What have you read recently that you’d like to recommend?</strong></em></p>
<p>Roxane Gay’s <em>Hunger</em>, which was absolutely powerful and important. <em>The House of the Scorpion</em> was awesome. Zach Doss’s short story <a href="https://www.puertodelsol.org/single-post/2017/07/26/Bespoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Bespoke”</a> (and all of Zach Doss’ boyfriend stories, really). Any poems that pop up on my Twitter feed (I recommend reading all the poems). And I’m re-reading <em>The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake</em> and figuring out how fabulists become novelists, so if you (like me) are terrified of novel-writing, might be Step 1.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a long time I leave candles in the woods,<br />
hack at living roots, wait all night for a witch<br />
to cast a spell on my house.<br />
I want yards full of dinosaurs and giant<br />
cabbages, I want the woodpeckers<br />
to strike gold when they lay into a maple tree.</p>
<p>Here, rabbits’ coats change color in winter,<br />
berry bushes morph to agave, an old mariner appears only<br />
when it rains – unbreathing – to tell me<br />
what I’m not ready for.<br />
I cross the bridge that divides the beach,<br />
find the boy who likes me enough to let me<br />
squeeze beneath his umbrella, the girl who<br />
plays her flute in the drizzle, in the graveyard, the girl who loves<br />
the stars and electrocutes me<br />
on accident, who marries me<br />
three days after I ask her, who brings her bedroom<br />
to my house, goes spelunking and builds bombs and mends<br />
fences sometimes.  Years pass.<br />
What changes is</p>
<p>the strength of my pickax, the bows in my hair,<br />
the caverns that go down into the desert forever.<br />
It occurs to me, as I fill my bedroom<br />
with candles, my house does not</p>
<p>burn down, and I<br />
have never died.<br />
I have collapsed</p>
<p>in a garden, bled<br />
at the hands of skeletons, jumped<br />
into a hole I couldn’t see<br />
the bottom of, have come bleatingly back<br />
in the doctor’s office, the tears in my backpack<br />
leaking gems.  I have stood atop dynamite, carried</p>
<p>strawberries large as my head, fed a statue,<br />
fished in sewers, but I have never felt the sun.<br />
I have had the strength of a mouse, a mountain,<br />
a flea.  I have wanted badly</p>
<p>to dig up what I am sure is a boat on the beach but<br />
cannot.  I have wanted to wait<br />
in the witch’s house until she returns – or even slip off<br />
my shoes and swim – I never learned<br />
to swim.  I have married<br />
the shopkeeper’s daughter because of her moxie<br />
and purple hair, even though I wanted to marry<br />
the fisherman, the wizard, the goblin guarding<br />
the shack in the swamp.  I have wanted</p>
<p>to savor pufferfish and tree-sap until<br />
the whites of my eyes turned black.  To spike the punch, lock out<br />
the cows, wait for the wolves to come.<br />
To sleep an entire year.</p>
<p>Let’s say<br />
I do, say I let<br />
the gardens wither, erase the memory<br />
of my wife, never milk the goats, fill the forest<br />
with bombs.  These are the things<br />
I think about but don’t do.  Instead,<br />
I befriend the dwarf so he’ll tell me<br />
his secrets,  collect peaches, recycle the busted glasses<br />
I fished up from the sea.<br />
I have wanted to find</p>
<p>each fossil, each cracked<br />
vase and elf’s crown – to collect and fill up<br />
those blank spaces that encase<br />
my mind.  I<br />
have watched the cows<br />
give birth but never grow old,<br />
waited to see what<br />
my daughter would look like<br />
when (and would she?) leave the crib.<br />
I am scared</p>
<p>about what having a daughter means, how much<br />
like me she’ll be.  Will I get to teach her to fish?  Give her<br />
her sword?  Lead her through caverns I have yet<br />
to break a bone in?  She will be disappointed</p>
<p>to find every door already unlocked,<br />
every barrier cleared.  She<br />
already automated, me standing<br />
solid in her path.  How many seconds<br />
until she walks through me?<br />
I watch her plant a parsnip seed.<br />
Dread the day<br />
I turn her into doves.</p>
