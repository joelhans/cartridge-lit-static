<p><strong>THE ART OF GAMING</strong></p>
<p>According to its own site, <a href="http://deadendthrills.com/" target="_blank">Dead End Thrills</a> &#8220;<span>celebrates the talent of videogame artists and engineers via the hobby of taking screenshots.&#8221; Harris Duncan, who used to be a game industry screenshot artist and magazine writer, uses a number of techniques to highlight the artistry present in a wide range of games: everything from <em>Skyrim</em> (as pictured above) to <em>Flight Simulator X</em>.</span></p>
<p>Duncan has also posted a few feature articles on various video game studios and the people who helm them, with more glorious screenshots and in-depth interviews.</p>
<p>In the past there&#8217;s been a lot of talk about whether video games can be considered art. Dead End Thrills sort of obviates that argument, at least from the visual and technical sides—the people who make these games are clearly doing so with an eye for the artistic. Perhaps not every moment of a game can be considered as such, but there certainly is an accumulation of visuals and ambiance, and the capacity to create art within the player.</p>
<p>All the screenshots on the site are free to use for non-commercial purposes. I&#8217;m currently doing so for a yet-unannounced project for <em>Cartridge Lit</em>. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>AT THE INTERSECTION OF VIDEO GAMES AND LITERATURE</strong></p>
<p>This one is an oldie, but still well worth the read. In &#8220;<a href="http://www.themillions.com/2014/04/appetite-for-risk-at-the-intersection-of-video-games-and-literature.html" target="_blank">Appetite for Risk: At the Intersection of Video Games and Literature</a>,&#8221; Maxwell Neely-Cohen (author of <em>Echo of the Boom</em>) takes on the disconnect between video games and literature, and tries to find common ground between the two seemingly disparate industries. The piece is filled with gems: &#8220;What is particularly sad about this state of affairs is that the literary world and the video games world could greatly benefit each other. Even a conversation, let alone the beginning of real collaborations and dialogues, would help each contend with their respective shortcomings.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that many younger writers have been (and continue to be) enormously influenced by video games—the titles from Boss Fight Books are one indication, as is <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/07/29/play-leave-luck-heaven/" title="Play This: Leave Luck to Heaven" target="_blank">Brian Oliu&#8217;s <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em></a>, as is this very endeavor and all its contributors. Personally, I can safely say that games like <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> certainly challenged my young mind to think about narrative in ways it might not have otherwise. I don&#8217;t take much influence directly from those games any more (although that&#8217;s changing, too), but I certainly recognize them for pushing me in new directions.</p>
<p>Neely-Cohen thinks both industries can do more: &#8220;We should be making novels into video games, video games into novels. Publishers should collaborate with indie game developers, trading them a platform and content in exchange for labor and a new form of adaptation. Literary magazines and libraries should sponsor gamejams. The games industry should fully embrace the thousands of works of classic literature open to them in the public domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard to argue with that one.</p>
<p>The piece has actually been the inspiration for us to ask our contributors, in our <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/tag/writergamer/" target="_blank">Writer/Gamer Q&amp;A series</a>, about what novels they would like to see turned into video games, and what kind of video game could be made out of their own lives.</p>

<p><strong>ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME SPEEDRUN IN 18:10</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely not <em>into</em> the speedrun community, but this one popped up on my radar and it&#8217;s just too interesting not to mention. Cosmo Wright has made a name for himself doing a variety of speedruns, but apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6pGJbd6Iw" target="_blank">this &#8220;world record&#8221; run</a> is his <em>magnum opus</em>, at least so far.</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq6pGJbd6Iw]</p>
<p>More than anything, these are fascinating for the way they manipulate game worlds to do things they were absolutely not intended to do. It reminds me a bit of magic, the breakage of all bounds and constants.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Every Tuesday, or at some other completely random denomination of time, I&#8217;ll be making some gaming-related recommendations. I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/tag/play-this/" target="_blank">Play This</a>&#8221; for now. Yeah. These might be video games themselves, or books, or articles, or who knows what?</em></p>

<p><strong>LEAVE LUCK TO HEAVEN</strong></p>
<p><em>Cartridge Lit</em> contributor Brian Oliu (<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/05/05/goonies-ii/" title="Goonies II" target="_blank">read &#8220;Goonies II&#8221; here</a>) has a new book out, <em>Leave Luck to Heaven</em>, from Uncanny Valley Press. The book is a collection of video game-twinged lyric essays that have been published in just about every literary magazine imaginable, including <em>Cartridge Lit</em> (I think we got in there last-minute), and they&#8217;re both vicious and tender. They&#8217;re short but they feel so much more substantial than their lengths.</p>
<p>This is far more than some nostalgia-fueled homage to 8-bit gaming—Oliu has clearly mastered a form and a technique and these essays accumulate in so many unexpected ways. There&#8217;s little in the way of narrative twists or single &#8220;darling&#8221; sentences. The lyrical writing, for which Oliu is well-known, is about as visceral as it gets: the closest we can get, I think, to living inside these games, and to living inside the memories that are interwoven within the experiences of playing each of the many classics. And as a teachable piece of craft, this is about as good as it gets.</p>
<p>The press itself, which is run by Mike Meginnis and Tracy Bowling out of Iowa City, is open for <a href="https://uncannyvalley.submittable.com/submit" target="_blank">book-length submissions</a>. They have also published two issues of a literary magazine (but don&#8217;t any more) and a handful of pieces online. Check them out at <a href="http://uncannyvalleypress.com" target="_blank">uncannyvalley.com</a>.</p>
<p>Brian&#8217;s book can be bought for $12 flat by going to the Uncanny Valley site and clicking that orange-ish &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button. So go do that.</p>

<p><strong>CHILD OF LIGHT</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://childoflight.ubi.com/col/en-US/home/index.aspx" target="_blank"><em>Child of Light</em></a> is a relatively new RPG from Ubisoft Montreal—a departure for the studio that has previously focused primarily on big and bloody franchises like <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em>—which puts the player in the role of Aurora, a young (and hopelessly ill) girl from Austria. One day, Aurora wakes into the world of Lemuria, and her real story begins. There&#8217;s missing moons and a quirky cast of characters and, naturally enough, an evil force that goes by the name Umbra.</p>
<p>The game will feel familiar to those who have played JRPGs, whether in the 16-bit past or more recently. Each character has different skill tracks that offer various benefits depending on how you want your characters to fit together—focus this one on physical attacks so that another might center around healing? The combat system is actually quite fun, taking the standard Active Time Battle (ATB) system and giving it a unique twist. Characters all progress up the gauge at their own speeds, and various attacks/spells take an additional, and wildly variable, amount of time. The player can then use Igniculus, the firefly sidekick, to slow down enemies—time your attacks right and one can &#8220;interrupt&#8221; enemies, leaving them unable to attack.</p>
<p>Another unique element is the platforming—to move around the world, Aurora runs, jumps and flies around trees and caves in a way that&#8217;s more <em>Mario</em> than <em>Final Fantasy</em>. It reminds me a bit of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Don&#8217;t want to fight that battle? Figure out how to jump around it.</p>
<p>Other strong points: the game is simply gorgeous (I mean, damn), and the music hums along quite nicely. As a sensory experience, this is pretty high-class.</p>
<p>The game can be bought for $14.99 on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/256290/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NO SKIN THICK ENOUGH</strong></p>
<p>Gaming site <em>Polygon</em> has published two important pieces in the last week or so about the rampant and disgusting mysogyny and sexism in the wider gaming community. In the first piece, &#8220;<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5926193/women-gaming-harassment" target="_blank">No skin thick enough: The daily harassment of women in the game industry</a>,&#8221; Brianna Wu shares a number of awful stories from women in the industry: everything from harassment to racist remarks to death threats. It&#8217;s hard to read, but it&#8217;s an important conversation. Men in particular should take note: even if we&#8217;re not the problem ourselves, this is what our greater community is like for women. And it&#8217;s not okay.</p>
<p>On that note, the site posted a follow-up piece about <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/7/24/5933565/online-sexism-what-can-be-done-women-gaming-harassment" target="_blank">what allies can do to help</a> battle the sexist portion of the gaming world, and help support the women who are affected by it. Both are good reads no matter your own gender—they certainly have implications that are wider than video games.</p>
<p>People shouldn&#8217;t have to thicken their skin just to be a part of the gaming community. It&#8217;s supposed to be inclusive. Just because games take us to different worlds does not mean that we shouldn&#8217;t try to make this one better.</p>
