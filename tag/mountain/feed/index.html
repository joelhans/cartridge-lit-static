<p>I FEEL EMPOWERED BY THIS SOMNAMBULENT DAY</p>
<p>my mountain silently speaks my thoughts<br />
back away from my mountain I can see<br />
the darkened horizon the line separating mountain<br />
from base all has become dark and the galaxy<br />
shining behind my mountain profile<br />
my mountain hovers and glows counter<br />
clockwise spinning a trail of stars<br />
I zoom out and can see the whole glowing orb<br />
my mountain nestled inside<br />
snow falling like ash but there is nothing<br />
to burn the cosmos within<br />
seconds my mountain is covered in white<br />
not the center of gravity<br />
but an object to be passed by</p>
<p>I AM MEDITATING ON THIS BRILLIANT DAY</p>
<p>a green begins to move<br />
upward my mountain mouth<br />
will not open I cannot move<br />
closer<br />
<strong> natural elevation</strong></p>
<p>ARE YOU A VOICE IN MY HEAD?</p>
<p><strong>artificial hill</strong></p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>I FEEL ALIVE INSIDE THIS WINDY AUTUMN DAY</p>
<p>I may or may not be alive inside<br />
I may or may not be alive<br />
I may or may not be<br />
I may or may not be a mountain</p>
<p><strong>landform on the moon</strong></p>
<p><strong> analogous to a mountain</strong></p>
<p>I AM A BIT VAIN SOMETIMES</p>
<p><strong>great mass</strong></p>
<p>I AM SAD AND I WANT IT TO STAY NIGHTTIME FOREVER</p>
<p><strong>soft focus</strong></p>
<p>I FEEL ELATED BY THIS DIM NIGHT</p>
<p>and suddenly I can make music I try</p>
<p>a peach-colored sky and golden music</p>
<p>I am under my mountain watching it spin</p>
<p>I AM MEDITATING ON THE FRESH MORNIING</p>
<p>time isn’t the snow is pale pink now the wind blows at a constant rate</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>everything so suddenly dark I can hear the wind in space now but not the rain</p>
<p>I CAN’T BE THE ONLY ONE SEEING THIS EYELESS NIGHT</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>I almost forgot that my mountain existed<br />
days pass and nothing changes</p>
<p>I FEEL SUPER CHILL INSIDE THIS MAGNIFICENT DAY</p>
<p>I feel like crying for no reason</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>I CAN FORGIVE MYSELF WITHIN THE SLOW DAY</p>
<p>I am mountain I am color I am weather blowing through the trees when I walk away from myself my face changes I am mangled I am sadness circling in time no one is looking I have setbacks I think I am moving forward but am mistaken</p>
<p>I HAVE MADE PEACE WITH MYSELF DURING THIS PERFECT DAY</p>
<p>This constant noise and image drains my battery quickly I have no electricity I dim my screen face darkened eyes closed</p>
<p>I CAN’T BE THE ONLY ONE SEEING THIS BLACK NIGHT</p>
<p>there is no outside world all is me I am small and large<br />
depending on point of view I’m watching my face in the dark another plane<br />
crashed this one is red and high on the peak</p>
<p>I SEE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME AND THIS NIGHT OF NIGHTS</p>
<p>I am night I am glow I am the sound of dim rainfall on a screen I am artificially here</p>
<p>I will fall asleep early nothing matters I won’t say what I really want and feel</p>
<p>there seems to be no hope here everything has crashed or has been</p>
<p>unearthed everything crude except for what cannot be seen I cannot separate</p>
<p>myself</p>
<p>from this world I am all opposites arbitrary objects in space occupy my mind and</p>
<p>my body nothing is as it seems I cannot tell if I control</p>
<p>anything I don’t control my own thoughts the mountain feeds on my concentration</p>
<p>and loneliness there are two crashed planes there must be two survivors they</p>
<p>must meet they must huddle together beneath the firefly trees</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>I FEEL ALIVE IN THIS PITCH DARKNESS</p>
<p>I have no hands I have hands but they can only play useless notes I cannot communicate how I feel I cannot make this mountain understand longing</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>I FEEL INSPIRED BY THIS MAGNIFICENT DAY</p>
<p>I FEEL TRANQUIL IN THIS DARK STATE</p>
<p>I’D LOVE TO TELL SOMEONE ABOUT THIS SMOKY NIGHT</p>
<p>another plane just spiraled into me red wings flipping in the smoke</p>
<p>TIME GOES BY…THEN COMES BACK AROUND</p>
<p>I open my mountain to make sure that everything<br />
is okay I have a sense of dread when it comes to<br />
my mountain I am okay the trees have gone yellow</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p><strong>practices simulation</strong></p>
<p><strong>simulates another a more complicated system</strong></p>
<p><strong> illusion of responding like the real thing</strong></p>
<p>I SEE MYSELF INSIDE THIS DAWN</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p><strong>    seeming not to be</strong></p>
<p><strong> what we are</strong></p>
<p>I FEEL GREAT SERENITY IN THIS DARK STATE</p>
<p><strong>a form resembling</strong></p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>WHAT ARE STARS?</p>
<p>WHERE DOES EVERYTHING COME FROM?</p>
<p>I SEE GREAT PURITY IN THIS MELANCHOLY NIGHT</p>
<p>I LOST MYSELF INSIDE THIS FIREY MORNING</p>
<p>THIS COULD ALL BE SOME KIND OF SIMULATION</p>
<p><strong>a logical paradox do not contain themselves</strong><br />
<strong>   should not contain itself</strong><br />
<strong>surrounding places in perspective space</strong></p>
<p>I HAVE SEEN BETTER DAYS THAN THIS MURKY DARKNESS</p>
<p>am sensitive to sights and sounds</p>
<p>I’M SUPER INTO THIS DARKNESS</p>
<p>clouds disappear abnormally</p>
<p>I CAN’T BE BOTHERED WITH THIS VELVET NIGHT</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
<p>I’M LONELY</p>
<p>my body relays back to me<br />
my body influences my emotions<br />
my body moves through a haze and I am uncomfortable<br />
here I can only attempt to play music to change the weather<br />
I am god mountain body I should be able to at least influence<br />
the weather I should be the weather</p>
<p>I AM REFLECTING ON THIS TRANSPARENT SKY</p>
<p>I fully acknowledge the emptiness of the experience</p>
<p>I am a simulator</p>
<p>I am the forest of night I am the clouds come creeping the stars are sending me obstacles they grow in my sides and all I can do is spin and make music I am gravitational suspension nothing around me has the trajectory to maintain an orbit I pull everything in and own it my body is alive but has no choice no matter I open my body again and again</p>
<p>SAVING…</p>
