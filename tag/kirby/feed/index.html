								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fallout</strong></p>
<p>The screen says it’s simple: one button<br />
and every bit gets flushed from memory.</p>
<p>How many polygons does it take<br />
to build all those dead bodies?</p>
<p>How long before the blue screen<br />
says forget about the bomb?</p>
<p>Ghosts turn away<br />
when we look them in the eye</p>
<p>which presents the question<br />
these games can’t answer:</p>
<p>Who are we to say<br />
this place needs saving?</p>
<p>Maybe we give in<br />
to the sounds of Bob Crosby,</p>
<p>grind the polycarbonate<br />
into piles of plastic dust,</p>
<p>raise the warm mounds<br />
to our mouth and blow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kirby of the Stars</strong></p>
<p>Last night my mother died<br />
in my dreams. I went on</p>
<p>kicking piles of snow into televisions,<br />
inhaling bombs, throwing apples at oak trees.</p>
<p>In my bedroom I hang<br />
myself some reminders:</p>
<p>A broken star rod.<br />
A fountain filled with hammers.</p>
<p>I only know how to be other people<br />
by pulling them inside myself.</p>
<p>I turn into a tornado,<br />
blow through a megaphone.</p>
<p>It’s Christmas and I remember<br />
her saying time is a flat circle,</p>
<p>and stars are just burning balls of hydrogen<br />
that expire before you can see them.</p>
<p>When I wake up, I’ll turn all my clocks into triangles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&gt;GET LAMP</strong></p>
<p>&gt;<em>look</em><br />
you are standing<br />
in an open field.<br />
north of a house<br />
with a boarded front door.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>open mailbox</em><br />
your finger thumbs<br />
an orange leaflet.<br />
Eviction the only word<br />
you read. The rest forgotten.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go south </em><br />
you are behind<br />
a broken window.<br />
enough to slip in.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>enter window</em><br />
inside: stale popcorn,<br />
candle wax crusted over<br />
an oriental carpet.<br />
under the wooden table:<br />
a sword.<br />
a brass lamp.<br />
a cellar door.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>get lamp and sword</em><br />
you’re left heavy<br />
raising the scabbard<br />
while your other hand holds<br />
the lamp waiting for kerosene.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go down</em><br />
a staircase descends<br />
into a dark basement.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>look</em><br />
you can barely see<br />
through the dark<br />
the boxes of baseball cards<br />
a pink panther action figure</p>
<p>&gt;<em>ignite lamp</em><br />
ignite is not a verb that’s recognized.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>kill with sword</em><br />
there is nothing<br />
to kill.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>kill with sword</em><br />
there is nothing<br />
to kill.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go back</em><br />
you can’t<br />
go that way.</p>
<p>&gt;<em>go home</em><br />
you can’t<br />
see any such thing.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I once won a Gameboy at the grand-opening raffle of a Walmart. I’d been gunning for the new TV because mine had been busted for months, and I had to tell the girls at work to shut up at the lunch table so they wouldn’t spoil the evening soap operas for me. I brought the Gameboy over to Jess’s house, where I’d crash half the time because he’d make us frozen pizzas and let me watch his TV and sometimes hold my hand (but never kiss me). We were sort of best friends, sort of something else.</p>
<p>I had figured out how to play <em>Tetris</em> (though I wasn’t very good), but <em>Kirby’s Dreamland</em> left me tense. I’d jerk back and forth as though my body movements controlled the fat little cloud on the screen.  Jess had to beat the levels for me to move on. He made it look so easy. I loved watching him, his fingers dancing, eyes darting. He’d try to explain what he was doing, show me which buttons to press in which order.  <em>You’re terrible</em>, he’d say, smiling after I died—again. <em>I know, </em>I’d say back. <em>I’m the worst</em>.</p>

<p>The next time I come over, there is a wrapped package on the coffee table.  It isn’t my birthday. The paper is glittery Christmas trees even though it’s mid-June. I’m here to steal his air conditioning because mine’s out again.</p>
<p><em>Go on, open it</em>, he says. I tear at the tape, unveiling a heavily packaged plastic box of some sort. <em>What is it? </em>I ask. The label says Game Genie. <em>It’s to help you win at the games. When I’m not there. Here, let me show you</em>. I hand it over, and he takes his pocket knife out to free the Genie from its cage. <em>You stick it in here, put in a code, and ta-da! What do you want? Infinite time? More vitality bars?</em> He’s flipping through a little book, punching numbers into the game console.  <em>Isn’t that like cheating? </em>I ask.  <em>I guess. That’s why they call them ‘cheat codes’. But it’s just for fun. </em>I lean closer to watch what he’s doing. I’m so close we could kiss, but we don’t. Instead he says:  <em>I’m moving. Back home. My mom keeps getting sicker. And&#8230;I’ve been talking to Mara again</em>. Mara, his ex-girlfriend.  <em>Okay</em>, I say. I have no other words, so he fills the silence with <em>It might not work. Nothing is set in stone. And I’ll only be three hours away.</em></p>
<p>I feel silly, sitting there with him like we are something. I stand up. He hands me the Gameboy and for a second, our fingers touch and I know he wants me to look at him, but I can’t. I put the Gameboy and its Genie in my purse and leave before telling Jess this stupid thing I’d been thinking a few minutes ago: <em>I want this thing to be a real genie, emerging in a puff of sweet-smelling smoke. I want three wishes. One, I want infinite time with you, two, infinite lives with you. And three, I want to be able to see the final sequence without having to play the damn game over and over until my fingers are raw: the tinkling music, the Russian dancers, the rocket blasting off, the win with a single line.</em></p>
