								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of a church camp cottage—blankets muffling the rattle of windows, socked feet muting the floorboards moaning—I lean in and push my voice through an old T-shirt stretched over a microphone. <em>Oh, Axys.</em></p>
<p>He has dueled with the Dark One. His faith has cured a drought, a blight across the land brought on by the hopelessness and despair of my people. I don’t need to be told. I’ve known the story for years. <em>You are our hero.</em></p>
<p>Years ago, after a show, David inked an e-mail address onto the back of my hand in permanent black: thethirteenvoices@. I didn’t scrub hard in the shower, let the shadow of his name linger for days.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Axys.</em> He wouldn’t know me from Eve. But when he stops in front of me, mouses over the halo hovering above my head and presses his forefinger down—<em>click</em>—I need him to understand what he means to me. To all of us. <em>You are our hero.</em></p>
<p>Years ago, in a sanctuary, David pressed his hand into the soft arch beneath my ribs, made me aware of my body, how I was using it. “From here,” he said. <em>Oh, Axys.</em></p>
<p>The song came harder then through my rounded mouth, from somewhere deeper, vibrations hard enough to make his fingers tingle. And God help me, I was praising the Lord. You are our hero.</p>
<p>“Can you say it less…like you want him?” David asks. He grins and toggles a switch, adjusts his earphones, and I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>David’s right. It’s nothing personal. When I open the door into the heat of July, one of the other girls will walk in, grin at him, say a line, then say it again. Filling voices David can’t throw himself. A litany of praises for the redeemer.</p>
