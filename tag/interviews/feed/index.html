<p><em>Kim Stoll lives in Tucson, Arizona. She holds a BA in creative writing from Susquehanna University and an MFA in poetry from the University of Arizona. Her chapbook,&nbsp;</em>Anna Lives<em>, is available from Dancing Girl Press, and you can read her work online at&nbsp;</em>ILK<em>,&nbsp;</em>Birdfeast<em>,&nbsp;</em>Cloud Rodeo<em>, and&nbsp;</em>Alice Blue Review<em>.</em></p>



<p><em>Her&nbsp;essay,&nbsp;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2018/10/01/dead-or-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Alive,&quot; (opens in a new tab)">&#8220;Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Alive,&#8221;</a> appeared in&nbsp;our &nbsp;</em>Bug/Feature<em>&nbsp;Temple&nbsp;Issue. </em></p>



<p><em>Below,&nbsp;she&nbsp;talks&nbsp;with&nbsp;editor&nbsp;William&nbsp;Hoffacker&nbsp;about&nbsp;dissociation,&nbsp;poetry,&nbsp;rituals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;more.</em></p>



<p><strong>WH: How did your essay </strong>&#8220;<strong>Dead or Alive</strong>&#8220;<strong> start to take shape for you? Why did you choose to write about this video game and that particular moment in your life?</strong></p>



<p>KS: The easy answer is that one of the editors off-handedly suggested I submit something to <em>Cartridge Lit</em> and I thought to myself, “Do I have anything to say about video games?” I thought through my childhood and different games that had significance to me, and DOA was the first I thought of and the one that had the most story to unpack around it.</p>



<p>The death of my grandfather was a really significant loss in my life. At the time I wrote this essay, I had been seeing a trauma therapist, so I think I was especially in the mindset to unwrap this particular event and my response to it. I knew that disconnecting, going blank and leaving my body was a thing that I did as a coping mechanism all through my life, but before therapy I didn’t know there was a word for it and I also didn’t know how to control it.</p>



<p>So, there was this really intense, important event in my life that I just totally dissociated from and there was this video game that sort of helped me do that. I think this was something I was just ready to get into and try to unpack and the way I do that is through writing. Also, the built-in metaphor of the game title alone, <em>Dead or Alive</em>… It writes itself.</p>



<p><strong>Prior to this piece, all of your published work has been poetry. What lessons have you learned from writing poetry that serve you well as an essayist (or a prose writer in general)?</strong></p>



<p>I think my work in poetry has afforded me way more freedom in my prose writing. Poetry taught me how to just make leaps, to move on quickly. And to be terse and economical with language. To just trust readers way more. Poetry doesn’t hold your hand and explain things, and I think that can be really freeing when you write prose and you don’t feel obligated to the reader in the same way. Also, there’s the obvious stuff poetry teaches you like distilling moments into a single image, relying on imagery and metaphor, and finding pleasure in the rhythm and sonic quality of a sentence, that kind of stuff.</p>



<p><strong>What are the leading obsessions in your writing? What themes or subjects do you return to most often?</strong></p>



<p>Well, I think I earned myself the reputation of being the “dead animal girl” in my undergrad writing workshops, and it’s not untrue. I’ve written a lot about the natural world and people’s relationship to wildness &amp; wilderness. I grew up in a hunting family and return to that world a lot in my writing. I also like spooky shit. I like blood and guts in my poems. I like the idea of sound as a type of violence. Despite living in the desert, I’m obsessed with frozen landscapes, cold brutal places.</p>



<p>I guess at the heart of it all though, it’s all circling types of violence and trauma. So, even though this essay isn’t about my usual subjects it’s still in that thread.</p>



<p><strong>In 2018 you began writing seasonal Divinations on <a href="https://www.kimstoll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="your web site (opens in a new tab)">your web site</a>, in which you describe throwing bones, gathering with a coven, and other witchy things. Please describe how, when, and why you began engaging in these neo-pagan rituals (if I may call them that). What is their appeal for you?</strong></p>



<p>Wow, well. This one is complicated. I don’t want to bore readers with an essay on Why I’m a Witch Now. But, here are a few thoughts about this (sorry if it gets long!):</p>



<p>&gt;One simple answer is that I started posting these divinations as a way to force myself to write a non-work-related thing to completion at least once a season. It’s generative. I also wanted to practice divination methods and, again, this commitment of posting to my website forced me to stick with it.</p>



<p>&gt;Another factor is that in the current state of the world, I often feel totally powerless, and have these deep feelings of anger and terror and confusion. Witchy-stuff is a way to sort of deal with those feelings. There’s a reason all these witchy, “woo woo” things are having a moment right now in our culture. I think it helps people feel in control, or helps give them answers, or helps connect them with the earth or plants or the stars or the physical world around us or to something spiritual. A lot of the practices at their core are about taking time to actually be in the present moment, to slow your thoughts and focus your intentions. It’s about mindfulness. Divination in particular I think can be a type of self-therapy, it’s a vehicle through which to understand a situation and talk your way through a problem.</p>



<p>&gt;In terms of spirituality, I guess I’d say I’m an animist, though that’s not really a set of beliefs as it is just a way of being in the world. Anyway, all this witch stuff is connected to that. For those interested, I’d suggest reading the academic essay “The animal versus the social: rethinking individual and community in Western cosmology” by Priscilla Stuckey. It’s really interesting and has to do with the stories we tell ourselves, the mythologies and philosophies that have shaped our current western culture and given the state of climate change and “how things are going,” maybe there are alternative ways we could engage with the world? Maybe trying to connect to the wisdom and power of the natural world isn’t so silly? &nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;For several years, I’ve been fixated with the idea of becoming an old and powerful crone. It’s just a vibe I want to have and an aesthetic I really appreciate. I even insisted on playing a old crone in my DnD group. I guess at some point I was like, wait I can actually do that, it doesn’t have to just be a fantasy, I can hang weird plants around my house, I can make potions in a cauldron, I can curse people!</p>



<p>&gt;I took a workshop with CA Conrad on the occult and rituals, and they basically made me a witch. (I hope this gets back to them). If you’re not familiar with CA’s work you should definitely check it out. But they have these (Soma)tic Poetry Rituals, and I learned that through ritual you can kind of stop yourself from dissociating and be really present in yourself and in your writing. So, yes, this witch stuff does connect back to my <em>DOA</em>&nbsp;essay in a tangential way.</p>



<p>Also, CA talked about lion’s mane mushrooms, and though you can buy it in capsule form, you can’t find the actual mushrooms for sale in a grocery store and we don’t live in a place where you can wild harvest it, so I decided to grow it in my house and briefly got really into mushroom growing. And my house felt really witchy and weird and I was like “I’m into this. I dig this. Let’s see where this takes me.”</p>



<p>&gt;It’s fun! It’s fun to gather with friends and make stuff like candles or tinctures or wreaths or whatever and eat a ton of food. Rituals are fun and creative and good outlets for our constant state of anxiety!</p>



<p>Anyway, if ya&#8217;ll want personalized bone readings hit me up. I&#8217;m still learning, but they say practicing is the only way to get really sharp at this.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>If you could adapt any literary work into any type of video game, what work would you choose and why, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></p>



<p>Okay, yeah. Mathias Svalina does this Dream Delivery Service. He was in Tucson maybe two years ago and I subscribed for a month of dreams. He writes dreams every day and delivers them on bike to your doorstep early every morning. So, by the time I was up and leaving for work, I’d have this pink envelope stuck in my screendoor with a dream in it. The dreams are prose poems, for those not following.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’d adapt that. It would be like this: every day there’s a new five-ten minute experience you can play through. It’s one of those games where you just walk around and experience things (sorry, I don’t know video game lingo. I know there’s a word for this type of game. First-person walkabouts?). You briefly immerse yourself in a new dream reality every day and that’s it. That’s the game.</p>



<p><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></p>



<p>I have at least three different projects semi-started. Incubating? Maybe they’re all connected.</p>



<p>I’ve been writing a series of poems in this witch-aesthetic vein that pull a lot from Baba Yaga folktales, and there’s also some hunting &amp; shamanism stuff in there. Who knows where that is going.</p>



<p>For awhile I was writing a lot of poems about my time working in an animal shelter and about dog/human relationships in general. I own four dogs and have studied dog training and canine behavior quite a bit, so I have a lot of thoughts to work out there.</p>



<p>I also have a project started that’s connected to all this work I’ve been doing exploring my PA Dutch ancestry and, well, I guess I haven’t been back East in a few years and maybe this writing is a type of nostalgia. But also, wow! There’s this history of folk medicine/ritual healing/folk magic-type stuff among the PA Dutch! So I’ve been exploring that a lot through my reading and writing. And I feel really excited for that whole project to manifest and come together.</p>



<p><strong>What have you read recently that you want to recommend?</strong></p>



<p>Hm. Almost everything I’ve been reading lately if very specific to “research” for writing projects. I’m not sure if I’d recommend ya’ll go out and read grimoires or Russian folktales or academic essays on the Siberian Yukaghirs.</p>



<p>Oh, you know what I would definitely recommend though? <em>Crapalachia: A Biography of Place</em> by Scott McClanahan. It came out a few years ago, but I just read it this year and yeah, would highly recommend.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Alyse Knorr is an assistant professor of English at Regis University and editor of Switchback Books. She is the author of the poetry collections  </em>Mega-City Redux<em> (Green Mountains Review 2017),  </em>Copper Mother<em> (Switchback Books 2016), and  </em>Annotated Glass<em> (Furniture Press Books 2013), as well as the non-fiction book  </em>Super Mario Bros. 3<em> (Boss Fight Books 2016) and the poetry chapbooks  </em>Epithalamia<em> (Horse Less Press 2015) and  </em>Alternates<em> (dancing girl press 2014). Her work has appeared in </em> Alaska Quarterly Review<em>, </em> Denver Quarterly<em>,  </em>Columbia Poetry Review<em>,  </em>The Greensboro Review<em>, and </em> ZYZZYVA<em>, among others. She received her MFA from George Mason University, where she co-founded Gazing Grain Press.</em></p>
<p><em>Below, Knorr talks with  </em>Cartridge Lit<em> contributor Elizabeth Deanna Morris Lakes about the Nintendo marketing machine, queer and female representation, the &#8220;Mona Lisa&#8221; of gaming, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><b>I saw you do a reading from your book, </b></em><b> </b><b>Super Mario Bros. 3 </b><em><b>(</b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b>)</b><b>, at AWP in LA in 2016. Before your reading, Gabe Durham, editor of Boss Fight Books, commented that while they knew there’d be a book on </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> eventually, they hadn’t planned to do one so soon after the </b><b>Super Mario Bros. 2</b><b> book, which had come out the season before. However! Your plan was so fully realized, he couldn’t say no to your pitch. Could you talk about your initial pitch for the book and how it changed (or didn’t!) as you wrote it? </b></em></p>
<p>One of my favorite things about Boss Fight Books is that each author takes their own unique approach to game writing and creative nonfiction. This meant I felt free to pitch a very hybrid blend of personal memoir alongside in-depth journalistic and scholarly research for my book.</p>
<p>A few things changed from pitch to final draft along the way. For instance, while I was hoping to talk to a current Nintendo employee, they’re a notoriously hush-hush company so this didn’t work out. However, I was incredibly lucky to be able to speak with <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Howard_Phillips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard “The Gamemaster” Phillips</a> and <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/12/how-we-played-with-power-secret-history-of-nintendo-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gail Tilden</a>, two important Nintendo employees at the time <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> (<em>SMB3</em>) came out. Their interviews were hugely helpful for providing insight into the <em>SMB3</em> era, and into what made this particular game so special.</p>
<p>As a whole, my research process gave me an even deeper enjoyment of and appreciation for <em>SMB3</em>. When I first started writing the book, I thought I already knew every single in-game secret and Easter Egg, but my research revealed way more—like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcTV9OQMgF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white mushroom houses</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l2Pnu9FnXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coin ships</a>, and a trick for <a href="http://protipoftheday.com/node/200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to determine</a> which direction a mushroom will veer toward after it pops out of a question mark block. I was also surprised to discover how pervasive <em>SMB3</em> has been in my life. In my pitch, I focused on my relationship with my father, who taught me to play <em>SMB3</em> before I knew how to read, and on how the game provided an outlet for my budding lesbian identity. As I wrote the book, however, I found even more connections to my own life, like the role <em>SMB3</em> played in my relationships with my little brother and with several friends.</p>
<p>Finally, as I interviewed a number of gaming experts and read dozens of reviews and analyses of <em>SMB3</em>, I became obsessed with a question that I hadn’t included in my initial pitch: how and why did this game achieve the cult status it did? Is <em>SMB3</em> truly “great,” or is all the hype just nostalgia? The answer I learned is: both. It <em>is</em> the “Mona Lisa” of gaming, as far as level design, flow state, cutting-edge features, replayability, and even music are concerned, but there are also many factors (see below) that make it a perfect object for nostalgia. And this combination is why it’s such a fondly remembered, cult-status game.</p>
<p><em><b>The question of nostalgia is a huge point in your book, as  </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> is a game that’s integrated itself into the collective consciousness of both gamers and non-gamers alike. Even I, who am notably terrible at this game, can hum the tunes and tell you all about the various enemy sprites more than I could any other game from this era. While I think it’s obvious why this game is so meaningful to those who played it rigorously (It’s innovative! Adorable! Bright!), could you talk more about how this game was able to create nostalgia for those less dedicated? Do you think there are any current games or franchises that might create this nostalgia for the youth today?</b></em></p>
<p>A perfect storm of influences makes <em>SMB3</em> so powerful as an object of nostalgia for an entire generation. First off, any beloved game or toy is going to produce intense feelings of nostalgia, because it’s associated with pleasant feelings from childhood. There’s a whole new Netflix series about this out now called <em>The Toys That Made Us</em>. But according to Phillips, <em>SMB3</em> is a particularly resonant object of nostalgia because it’s such a colorful, cartoonish, “cute” game—its joyful, goofy tone perfectly captures the innocence of youth in a really meaningful way.</p>
<p>We also remember <em>SMB3 </em>so well because it’s a masterpiece of game design. The tunes stick in your head because genius composer <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Koji_Kondo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koji Kondo</a> wrote them to do just that. You remember the enemies so well because they were engineered to be funny, adorable, and memorable—the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Koopalings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koopalings</a> are all named after rock musicians, for crying out loud! At the time of <em>SMB3</em>’s release, game developers were still a little spooked by the huge Atari Crash of 1983, so Nintendo was operating an intense quality control system. They simply weren’t putting out bad games.</p>
<p>Another huge nostalgia factor was <em>SMB3</em>’s marketing campaign, which was utterly massive. In the era of <em>SMB3</em>, Nintendo of America had recently hired a new head of marketing and significantly stepped up their strategies. The campaign for <em>SMB3</em> created an unprecedented level of hype. Eleven months after <em>SMB3</em>’s release, it was still the second highest-selling toy in the U.S., with the NES console itself in first place. The game was marketed like a Blockbuster movie, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU80R7jGanE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV commercials</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY7qEa7QJBs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV show</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSxdvRoa-1k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDonald’s Happy Meal toys</a>; and a ton of merchandise, memorabilia, toys, and clothes. This was also the heyday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Nintendo Power</em></a> magazine, the Nintendo-published magazine that served as a powerful advertising tool. <em>SMB3</em> was the first game to get its own dedicated issue <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZR5YB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy guide</a> from <em>Nintendo Power</em>, which made everyone hungry for the game itself to come out. And we can’t forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbqd2QMkuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Wizard</em></a>, a Fred Savage kids’ movie that was essentially, in the words of David Sheff, a 90-minute <em>SMB3</em> ad that audiences paid to view. What all this adds up to is that for many of us, our <em>SMB3</em> nostalgia is not only for the game itself, but also for the feeling of anticipation that led up to it.</p>
<p>Finally, the game’s timing made it essentially ubiquitous for American children. It’s easy to forget that in 1990, Nintendo was at the absolute peak of its reign over the video game industry, controlling 80% of the home console market. One in three American homes had a Nintendo console. So when Nintendo released a new game in this era, everyone noticed. And, according to Tilden, this was exactly Nintendo of America President <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Minoru_Arakawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minoru Arakawa’s</a> strategy: for everyone to be playing the game at the same time, talking about it on the playground, and spreading the hype. For this reason, even if you didn’t have an NES or have <em>SMB3</em>, you probably played it at a friend’s house or heard folks talking about it at school. And if not that, then you probably heard a commercial or caught a glimpse of the TV show or saw a kid wearing a T-shirt. Perfect storm.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine another game ever achieving this same exact combination of nostalgia triggers, but I suppose it could happen. In general, I think game and toy nostalgia for today’s youth is going to feel different from ours, because they’ve grown up with the internet where they have their own niches—there are far more playgrounds for them to talk on now.</p>
<p><em><b>It was so meaningful to me, as someone who’s dressed up as Link from the  </b></em><b>Zelda</b><em><b> series for Halloween at 12, 20, and 28, to read about your experiences of the game through a queer and female lens. I felt a deep sense of dread as I read about your performance at holidays, as you opened presents meant for who your relatives all thought you should be, not who you actually were (why can’t we just listen to our children?), though your own patient parents felt like a thrilling victory. But, and I apologize here for this bit of a tangent, while one could argue that  </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> is in many ways for anyone, it still has the princess as not only locked up and unattainable, but as part of a mysterious chase. Which is to say, it’s incredible that you found yourself in that game, but I feel like that discovery was partially out of your own wonderful imagination. Could you talk about how your imagination had to realign what you were given to fit your needs as a kid, without queer or even female representation there for you? </b></em></p>
<p>I’m always amazed at the creative ways that girls and queer people can imaginatively locate ourselves in male-dominated, heteronormative, and cisnormative narratives. It’s why subtext and camp are such significant elements of queer culture. And <em>SMB3</em> fits perfectly with this campiness—it’s full of performative elements like all the costumes, the theatre curtain that lifts up at the beginning of the game, the “off-stage” area at the end of every level, etc. <a href="https://kotaku.com/miyamoto-confirms-that-super-mario-bros-3-was-a-play-1729805751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miyamoto himself has confirmed</a> that all of <em>SMB3</em>’s characters are just actors in a play. This was a lot of fun for me to think about in terms of Butler’s theory of gender performativity, and the ways I have performed or failed to perform my assigned gender throughout my life. After all, when I was a girl, dresses felt like as much of a costume for me as Mario’s Tanooki suit.</p>
<p>So as a kid, I definitely had some of those negative experiences of feeling forced to perform a gender role that was constraining to me—including, like you mentioned, my big fake smile whenever I received a Barbie at Christmas. But what was important for me about <em>SMB3</em> was that it was a “safe” environment where I could perform my homosexuality by chasing/desiring the princess. I had this limitless free space in which to explore. And while I felt most connected to Mario, the princess-rescuing hero, I also related, subconsciously, to Bowser’s monstrosity and to the princess’s trapped status. So when me-as-Mario would defeat me-as-Bowser-the-monster, it was, on some level like I was overcoming my shame about being some kind of unnatural creature. And when me-as-Mario rescued me-as-trapped-princess, it was like I was overcoming the ways that society had “damseled” me and prescribed me gender roles that didn’t felt like they fit.</p>
<p>So I inhabited these self-generated, imaginary narratives in <em>SMB3</em>, with me as the hero, but I did this in other kinds of play, too—I was always Simba and not Nala, Robin Hood and not Maid Marian. And while I would have loved to have had Rey or the girl Ghostbusters growing up, I don’t regret that I didn’t, because it fine-tuned my imagination in ways I’m really grateful for. Until we get better gender representation in games, at least we have folks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-11-father-mods-donkey-kong-so-his-daughter-can-play-as-pauline-rescuing-mario" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this dude</a> who will hack into the code and make the changes themselves.</p>
<p><em><b>What was your favorite thing you learned in doing this deep dive of research for this book? Was there anything you learned that you couldn’t quite fit into the book?</b></em></p>
<p>My favorite discoveries all revolved around hardware, since this was the element I knew the least about as I began my research process and this was the info I found most difficult to dig up. What’s so special about <em>SMB3</em> is that it debuted late in the NES console’s life, so the developers really had to get creative and milk the console for all that it could do. This resulted in cutting-edge new features like screen-splitting (for the <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/super-mario-bros-3/screenshots/gameShotId,31691/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status bar</a> at the bottom of the screen), diagonal scrolling (for those maddening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6B_ARho00o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sky levels</a> in World 5), parallax scrolling (for the 3D effect that lets you drop behind the screen when you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owRYdqX4twM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crouch on a white block</a>), and animated tiles (for the moving question marks on blocks or the zooming card strips in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyiMXbKgeZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spade Panel mini-game</a>). Even Kondo got super creative with the hardware, using a certain sound channel in a really clever way to get it to produce more complex drum sounds. If you want to know what makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd78OMGLkVA&amp;list=PL6B16BD8C36B02A5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMB3’s soundtrack</a> so special, it’s all in the drums.</p>
<p>I found especially meaningful the fact that the game designers and software engineers saw the technical constraints of the era as a fun challenge rather than a frustrating limitation. In much the same way that a poet like me gets a kick out of the tight constraints of the sonnet form, <em>SMB3</em>’s team often found that working with such a tiny amount of memory (the Word Document I’m typing this in is five times the size of the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. file) often led to especially creative solutions. They truly loved the challenge and saw it as a way to show off their skills.</p>
<p>I did end up with a lot of extra material—my final draft probably incorporated about a third of all the fascinating research I found. This is fairly typical of my writing process—I like to write long and cut. I found way more scholarship on gender, sexuality, and gaming than I was able to use, and on the history of Mario as a character and Nintendo mascot. I also had to cut a playthrough of <em>SMB3</em> in which I taught my wife Kate how to play the game, which was really funny because she didn’t grow up with video games and enjoys teasing me about my obsession with Mario. I couldn’t put her playthrough anywhere in the book, but I loved doing it and have some very special memories from that experience.</p>
<p>Finally, I found a ton of super fun images, GIFs, trivia, and tips and tricks that just couldn’t fit anywhere into the book, so I put all of it up on <a href="https://supermariobrothers3.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Tumblr</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><b>I know, as someone who has read all your books, that you are also a poet! What else are you writing right now that we can look forward to? Do you plan to work on anything video game or pop culture related (like  </b></em><b>Mega City Redux)</b><em><b> soon? </b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for asking! I’m currently at work on two very different projects—the first is an opera libretto about the life of Christine de Pizan, the world’s first professional woman writer. After she was widowed at 25, Christine took up her pen in order to provide for her mother and three children. She became hotly engaged in debates with misogynist writers, writing long defenses of women that ultimately culminated in her 1405 allegory </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City of Ladies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which she dreamed up a world where women can live safe from sexism and gendered violence. In my book of poems </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mega-City Redux</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I imagine taking a roadtrip with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Xena Warrior Princess, and Dana Scully to search for the modern-day version of the city. What I’ve discovered after publishing that book, however, is that I’m still very much fascinated by Christine, and I want to share the story of her life and work with others. I’m writing the libretto by collaging together her original writings (in Middle French) and translating the resulting collage into modern French.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also working on a project called “Wolf Tours” that blends fiction and poetry to comment on eco-tourism, cultural appropriation, and depression. It’s a series of poems in the voice of a pack of wolves that runs a touring company. I’m having a lot of fun imagining what these wolves would sell in their gift shop, or how they would write a magazine ad for their company (poorly, it turns out).</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In  </em>Night in the Woods<em>, you play twenty-year-old Mae Borowski upon moving back to a hometown in decline. Her parents want to know why she just dropped out of college, her friends have all gotten jobs, her dreams keep getting weirder, and she believes there&#8217;s a mysterious threat lurking in the woods. </em>NITW<em> has won the BAFTA Game Award for Narrative and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival, among other accolades.</em></p>
<p><em>Scott Benson is the co-creator of  </em>Night in the Woods<em>. Below, Scott talks with </em>Cartridge<em> editor William Hoffacker about gothic horror, researching town histories, how Twitter helped him write dialogue, and more.</em></p>
<p><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b> begins with white text on a black background, with language and lineation evocative of poetry. Some lines are chosen by the player out of a few options, and some lines that follow reflect those choices. Although selecting words turns out to be a fundamental mechanic in the game, this prologue stands apart from the rest, as nothing else in the game looks quite like it.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>What is the intended purpose that necessitates this opening? What expectations is it meant to create? Why not just drop the player immediately into the first scene at the bus station?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mini interactive fiction bit at the start was sort of a statement of purpose, setting the tone of the game. We were about to put you right into the bus station with Mae, and things are colorful and funny and you’re learning to jump and run around for a while. But the game has other things on its mind, and we wanted to say up front, “Hey, this game has some preoccupations and context, let’s start thinking about that right from the jump.” The intro bit also gets across a lot of info in a very short amount of time, too. We wanted to give people a sense of where they were about to go, and who these people are, and what their context is. It feels out of place almost the first time you play the game, but I think eventually it fits right in as you get deeper into it, and especially if you do the recommended second playthrough. I’d say the game catches up to the info right around where Mae and Bea go the library and you start getting a lot of information about the town, and the themes of the game, which have been building through the first half, start emerging and interlocking in a way that matches up with that intro. That was the idea at least! Also it’s fun seeing Mae being all articulate and poetic, which she certainly is not for much of the game.</span></p>
<p><em><b>What sorts of literature do you most enjoy reading? What books (or other texts) had the most profound influence on the writing of  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two parts of the answer here—the literary influences and the research. Bethany did a whole lot of research for the history of Possum Springs. The game is based a lot on where she grew up, and she dove into old books detailing the ups and downs and struggles of towns like hers and Possum Springs. The history of labor struggle and exploitation, the out and out wars fought against bosses and police by workers, and the atrocities committed on entire towns by capital and the state, is often … well, suppressed maybe? We don’t learn a lot about it. But it’s there, and it’s not that long ago, and we still deal with these conditions today. Bethany is now practically an amateur historian of this kind of thing, and a lot of the details of the town’s past are pulled very much from real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as my end of things goes, I tend to read a lot of short story collections. I’ve been a pretty voracious reader all my life and I’m not sure why I have such a hard time getting through longer texts these days. Probably the untreated ADHD thing or something. So I take in a lot of shorter works, mostly horror or something lurid, folklore, and some general gothic lit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flannery O’Connor is an ever-present influence in the brand of gothic the game trades in. Her ability to explore the horrors lurking in southern Americana while suffusing the entire thing in this overarching, terrifying presence of grace, is an inspiration. I was a Christian for much of my life, was even in ministry, but lost my faith completely. But I connect with O’Connor’s “Christ-haunted” world. God is utterly gone for me, but the moments of grace remain in a beautiful naturally-occurring way, and exploring faith as a purely human phenomenon without anyone on the other end of the phone, so to speak, is interesting to me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Good Man Is Hard To Find</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wise Blood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were definite indirect influences in that arena, though O’Connor and I would disagree on the ultimate truth of God’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some weird fiction and cosmic horror makes it into the game as well, and it’s tough to get out from under the shadow of Lovecraft there. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Beyond</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a pretty direct influence on one pivotal scene. And we of course had our own plans for Lovecraft’s reactionary, racist, nationalist bullshit that pop up later on in the game. We do kind of a humanist, leftist cosmic horror, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d also shout out a little known weird fiction story called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dead Valley</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ralph Adams Cram. It’s one of the best “something weird is going on out there in the woods” stories ever.</span></p>
<p><b>Night in the Woods </b><em><b>frequently gives the player the opportunity to choose what the player-character, Mae, will say next. Such choices feel consequential, yet Mae is not some blank slate of a protagonist. She is an individual with a distinct, recognizable personality.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>So how did you strike that balance? What did you do to ensure that Mae would seem consistently herself while still giving the player a real sense of agency in directing her conversations?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t interested in empowering the player to roleplay. Alec and I decided from the start that this was Mae’s story, and she was her own person, and not a shell for the player. I really love exploration in games, and I think it’s maybe one of the best things you can do in a game both as a player and a designer. So navigating Mae’s life and navigating the dialogue is a type of exploration, just as running and jumping around the world is exploration. We were big on branching dialogue that felt organic and went on tangents, and were very anti Big Moral Choice moments. If anything we wanted to undercut any sense of the player being able to game her dialogue or character. This isn’t a game about making the Mae you want. It’s about exploring the Mae that is, and the world she lives in.</span></p>
<p><em><b>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any type, any scale), what work would you choose, and what might that game look and play like?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d love to see a good atmospheric horror post-point-and-click adventure game based on the Silver John stories by Manly Wade Wellman. Appalachian weird fiction. It’s dynamite and criminally unknown. The combo of easygoing wandering occult expert John The Balladeer and the devils lurking in various hollers is just so pleasing. Maybe just pick a handful of stories from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Fears The Devil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and run with it? And do it right. Actually wait don’t do this, I want to someday. I got dibs.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2649" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg 1920w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p><em><b>I assume that while you were writing dialogue for  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>, you knew that the game wouldn’t have voice acting, and instead the text would appear inside speech bubbles above the characters’ heads. Though the speech bubbles vary in size and shape, they never occupy a whole lot of real estate on screen.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>How much of a challenge was it to write all dialogue knowing it would be read within those confines? How did spatial limitations alter the content and/or the process of your writing?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on Alec and I knew we didn’t want to just do like a dialogue box at the bottom of the screen or something, and I sketched up some ideas of these fun little word bubbles and Alec implemented all of these expressive systems for making them wobble and boil, and animating the text and so forth. Writing for them became second nature very quickly, in part because I basically wrote everything in tweet length. I do a lot of twittering and it’s a platform that is underrated as far as style goes. You sort of learn how to segment longer thoughts, add pauses and single word tweets for humor and tension, all that kind of stuff. Twitter culture itself wasn’t a big influence on the dialogue, but the way Twitter trains you to work within strict character limits definitely was. So in the game we just learned to use that to our advantage. Also there’s nothing worse that opening up a conversation in-game and it’s just like paragraphs of unbroken text on screen. Chopping it up into smaller bits let us play with rhythm and pauses and personality and so forth. Also I think it feels better to click through a strategically segmented and timed series of bits than get hit with one big slab of dialogue.</span></p>
<p><em><b>If someone played  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b> and loved the experience so much that they just wanted more, more, more, what would you recommend they do next? (Recommendations might include other video games, but please feel free to answer however you like: books, movies, music, any activity, etc.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>. It’s a very clear influence on NITW. Seriously, drop what you’re doing and go play it. We owe a lot to that game. Similarly, <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em> has some DNA we swiped for our game. God, that game is a rare gem.</span></p>
<p><em><b>As large as religion looms over  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>, it wasn’t until my second playthrough that I noticed sun-shapes where I’d expect to see crosses. I realized that Christianity apparently doesn’t exist in this world because none of our cultural touchstones do. The characters speak of holidays different from ours. Saints and myths are recalled, but none we would recognize from history. Wars are invoked, but never by name. Even the constellations are invented. Also, the movies at the video store are made up (though  </b></em><b>The Shape of Water </b><em><b>seems derivative of  </b></em><b>Swamp Husband</b><em><b>), and I can’t recall any allusions to real-world celebrities (unless the Chris Evans run over by Mallard is </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>that</b></span><b> Chris Evans).</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>Why was it important to you that the game’s world be cut from whole cloth? How was your experience of originating so much at the cost of relying on established reference points—difficult, fun, both, something else?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>(Side-note: Writing this question brought to mind another game with anthropomorphic animals:  </b></em><b>Star Fox 64</b><em><b>. If the player shoots teammate Falco, he may respond, “Hey Einstein, I’m on your side,” which begs the question of why he uses the name Einstein in the same pejorative way that we do. One might ask, “Is their universe actually ours in the distant future? Do they have their own brilliant Einstein by coincidence?” Did you design  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><b> </b><em><b>to try to circumvent this sort of line of questioning?)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a pretty strict No Memes/No Reference Humor policy but we played the relationship to real world culture pretty loose. There are a very small handful of visual references and we mention like Shakespeare and a few other things from IRL culture here and there, but otherwise we wanted the world to exist on its own without propping ourselves up on some HEY REMEMBER THIS stuff. Like it’s fine to acknowledge or shout something out but we’ve had decades now of humor and culture that leans heavily on reference, and videogames are just rife with it. I think the Lovecraft material is the most blatant cultural riff in the game but that was because messing with cosmic horror stuff and his legacy in particular was a small part of what we were doing in the background. It was important for us to do as much as we could to create things that could stand on their own without having to fall back on reminding the player that they like <em>Star Wars</em> or whatever. A really clumsy overt reference in a work of fiction can throw me right out of it. And it’s just more fun and more interesting to create cultural touchstones that originate from and exist within the world you’re creating. It’s just a more satisfying way of doing things, and it feels more honest for lack of better words. That’s very much a your-mileage-may-vary thing but that’s where we came down on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as far as the religious symbology you mentioned, the church symbol in particular is part of a larger visual theme all over the place in the game, in a way a standard crucifix could never be.</span></p>
<p><em><b>What new games are you most anticipating right now? (Answers might include not only upcoming releases but also games already out that you haven’t gotten to play yet.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m really looking forward to the final episode of <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> which I believe drops this year. I played <em>The Witcher 3</em> for the first time earlier this year and was blown away by it, so I’m looking forward to the studio’s next game <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Whenever that comes out. <em>Ooblets</em> is looking really cool, and <em>Wandersong</em> seems like it’s gonna be some cheerful fun. Uh … <em>Dead Static Drive</em> looks super rad, as does <em>Knights And Bikes</em>. I’m probably forgetting something. Oh right I think there’s a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel out there somewhere. I’m a pretty big Souls games fan and I think the overall series could use a bit of a break but I’d definitely show up for a decent <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tacoma<em> is the latest game from Fullbright, the independent studio that first released  </em>Gone Home<em>. Both games feature a first-person p.o.v. player-character who explores an otherwise uninhabited environment, discovering a rich story by examining artifacts left by people who were once there. In  </em>Tacoma<em>, that setting is an abandoned lunar transfer station (the titular Tacoma), and the player attempts to learn the fate of its absent crew by accessing AR recordings of their lives. Enter a new part of the station and a new scene appears in the form of walking, talking figures, which the player can then play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward. Sometimes you follow characters from one room to another as they converse; you might hear how one crew member talks about another behind her back, then differently to her face. The experience creates a whole new sense of what it means to call a game&#8217;s story &#8220;immersive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Steve Gaynor is one of the founders of Fullbright. Below, he talks with  </em>Cartridge <em>editor William Hoffacker about  </em>Tacoma<em>&#8216;s development, his literary influences, and many games he recommends or looks forward to.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What were the greatest challenges of writing the story for  </em>Tacoma<em>?</em></strong></p>
<p>A lot of it was figuring out how to write a story in this way. The ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through <em>Tacoma</em>’s story meant that we had to think about writing the core scenes totally differently from how we had in any other game we’d worked on, or any other game we’d played, really. But once we had a working prototype of the AR scene playback mechanics, and a layout for the spaces the scenes took place in, we could start building out all the narrative threads within each scene as we supported what was happening at each point in the story—and from there the process was pretty natural, just a lot of work, hah.</p>
<p><strong><em>It seems to me that the first and foremost way that  </em>Tacoma<em>’s story could fail is if the player did not care what happened to the crew. What did you do (for example, via the dialogue, or visual cues, or any aspect of the game’s early moments) to try to ensure that your audience would immediately feel some attachment to the characters and thus want to discover their fate?</em></strong></p>
<p>The most important thing to us was to use the mechanics to allow the player to compare and contrast each character’s public vs. private self. The voyeurism of the AR scenes allows us to observe how the characters act when speaking to each other in a group, versus when speaking to each other in isolation, or how they behave when entirely on their own. We went for this early, for instance seeing EV’s take-charge nature with the crew in the debris impact scene, vs. her plaintiveness when back on her own in the bunk, or Clive’s gregarious banter with other members of the crew versus his private insecurities he shares with Germ. We hoped that this would allow the player to build a more complete picture of each of the characters as a fully realized individual, and build an attachment to them as a group of people they felt real empathy for.</p>
<p><strong><em>The station’s AI, ODIN, is visually represented by a large, humanoid eye inside a floating, upside-down pyramid. This imagery seems meant to evoke symbols associated with God, government, Illuminati tales—all likely to make one feel uneasy. What did you have in mind when you designed ODIN to look this way? What kind of player-reaction did you intend this model to evoke?</em></strong></p>
<p>ODIN, like many classic sci-fi AIs, is a presence whose true nature and motives are opaque to the player, especially at the start. The unknowability of AI is what makes them so fascinating. ODIN functions as a helper and coordinator on Tacoma, but he’s also always listening and watching—he’s directly tied to the digital surveillance that’s captured the 3D recordings you’re interacting with. So we wanted him to be an unblinking eye, and we wanted him to be a simple shape, an abstracted presence that could appear anywhere and interact with the crew. So that led us to the pyramidal all-seeing eye shape, flipped on its point to spin like a top. We also liked that, if you think of the iconic view of ODIN as being one side of the pyramid, ODIN is cycloptic, having one eye like the Norse god Odin, his namesake.</p>
<p><strong><em>Can you please describe the research that you did in order to develop  </em>Tacoma<em>? What kinds of texts did you read, and what types of people did you speak to?</em></strong></p>
<p>We did research on a few different vectors. We researched accounts of living in orbit on the ISS, and of living in extremely remote facilities such as research bases in Antarctica, to understand the dynamics and details of people confined to these kinds of places for long periods of time. We read books such as <em>An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth</em> by the astronaut Chris Hadfield, and various blogs and accounts by other astronauts and researchers. We also went back to a number of AI-themed science fiction novels and films, such as <em>2001</em>, <em>Moon</em>, <em>Alien</em>, and even classic texts like Asimov’s <em>I, Robot</em> for inspiration and reference points. As far as talking to individuals, probably the most direct interview research we did was with people in our circles who grew up in the Muslim faith. We wanted to get our depiction of Sareh right, so we talked to folks we knew when conceiving her character, and then had them play through a build of the game once her scenes were built and her bunk set up to see if we’d missed anything. Luckily it seems that with their help we were able to represent Sareh in an authentic way!</p>

<p><strong><em>What sorts of literature do you most enjoy reading? What books (or other texts) do you think had the most influence on the writing of  </em>Tacoma<em> and/or  </em>Gone Home<em>?</em></strong></p>
<p>I guess I have a fair breadth in what I read, though I have to admit I don’t read a whole lot compared to some people. I’m just a slow reader and easily distracted; it’s my own fault. But I guess I read a fair amount of modern lit (David Foster Wallace, Cormac McCarthy, Alice Munro…) and some classic sci-fi and crime fiction (Philip K. Dick, Jim Thompson) as well as some comics and graphic novels (Chris Ware, Adrian Tomine, I enjoyed <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters</em> by Emil Ferris last year, and am re-reading some of my old <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> books now…). I think that Alice Munro’s work as an author, and the TV show <em>My So-Called Life</em> were probably two of the most direct influences on <em>Gone Home</em>. <em>Tacoma</em> was probably more influenced by film and television: we drew from the crew of the Nostromo in <em>Alien</em>, and the vibe of Gerty from <em>Moon</em>, and the dynamic of McNulty’s unit from <em>The Wire</em> for how I thought about this group of misfits being thrown together and having to learn from each other and work within a system that’s bigger than any of them can comprehend. We were also deeply influenced by the immersive theater production <em>Sleep No More</em>, which is itself an adaptation/melding of Shakespeare’s <em>MacBeth</em> and Alfred Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>If someone played  </em>Tacoma<em> and/or  </em>Gone Home<em> and loved the experience so much that they just wanted more, more, more, what would you recommend they try next? (Such recommendations might include other video games to play, but please feel free to answer however you like: books, movies, music, even a long walk, etc.)</em></strong></p>
<p>As far as games go, I could recommend playing through <em>Minerva’s Den</em>, the downloadable story content for <em>BioShock 2</em> that Karla Zimonja, my story partner and studio co-founder, and I led together before we went indie to make <em>Gone Home</em>. It’s equal parts tragic romance and AI tale, and kind of forms a trilogy with <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Tacoma</em>. I’d also suggest some other games in the first-person story subgenre, like <em>The Beginner’s Guide</em> by Davey Wreden or <em>Firewatch</em> by Campo Santo. There’s a free game I really love called <em><a href="https://turnfollow.itch.io/packingup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packing Up the Rest of Your Stuff on the Last Day at Your Old Apartment</a></em>, which is about just what it sounds like, and is a simple and beautifully-crafted melancholic little game that’s well worth playing. I also loved this year’s <em>Butterfly Soup</em>, a visual novel-style game about a group of queer Asian teenagers who all love baseball. It’s incredibly funny, personal, and touching. I’d also suggest <em>Building Stories</em> by Chris Ware, a book collection that follows the story threads of one small apartment building in Chicago, and the people who live and die there. It’s incredibly inventive, beautiful, and heartbreaking, like so much of Ware’s work, and speaks to the personal and environmental style of storytelling that we focus on.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any type, any scale), what work would you choose, and what might that game look and play like?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think I’d adapt <em>Runaway</em> or <em>The Lives of Girls and Women</em> by Alice Munro. The sense of place and time and personal experience and the beauty with which Munro gives the reader a view into her characters’ lived experience is so vivid and so small that it feels just incredibly human. I’m not sure what the game would look or play like, but I just imagine how inhabiting those spaces and living through those moments could be really incredible.</p>
<p><strong><em>What new games are you most anticipating right now? (Answers might include not only upcoming releases but also games already out that you haven’t gotten to play yet.)</em></strong></p>
<p>Right now I hardly even have my eyes on the horizon as far as upcoming releases go. I’m still working on my backlog just from 2017. I played a ton of amazing stuff this year, but there are indie titles I still need to get to (<em>Detention</em>, <em>Everything Is Going to Be OK</em>, <em>Opus Magnum</em>, <em>Heat Signature</em>, <em>Mortician’s Tale</em>) and some AAA games I haven’t spent enough time with either (not far into the new Mario, though I did manage to finish the main quest in Zelda…). Conceptually, I loved <em>Resident Evil 7</em> a lot and I can’t wait to see where they go next after the huge shift that game was from prior entries in the series. <em>Far Cry 5</em> seems like it’s going into some intense territory with the new title and I’m really interested to see how that turns out. I’m incredibly intrigued to see what they do with <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>. Above all, I’m excited to see what new and unexpected indie and AAA games come out of nowhere to surprise us and give us experiences we’d never anticipated.</p>

<p><em>Ashley Harris’ </em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/06/24/if-the-hero-was-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>poems</em></a><em> are featured in our current issue, </em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/issue-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The </em>Next Gen<em> Temple Issue</em></a><em>. I recently sat down with Ashley via Google Hangout to chat about her work with </em>The Legend of Zelda<em> series and her thoughts on racialized bodies in video games. </em></p>
<p><strong>Phil: So, can you tell me a bit about your history and relationship with the <em>Zelda</em> series? What brought you to it? What makes it an especially complex subject for you, as opposed to similar games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ashley:</strong> Well that’s a great question! I was introduced to <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> when I was probably 12 years old by playing my little cousin’s Nintendo 64, and I remember we could never get past the Deku Tree level because there were spiders with skulls on their backs and we thought that was scary, but then one day I was provoked to finish it by my older guy cousin because he said that I was too girly to play such a game, then when I finished it I fell in love with the story, and I continued buying more <em>Zelda</em> games because the story of the hero coming from the woods and becoming a legend was inspiring, it’s what I’ve used to push myself in times of hardship. Also, other games don’t have the timeline, characters or rich history that each <em>Zelda</em> game has.</p>
<p><strong>P: Yea! The Deku tree is notoriously tough, and <em>Ocarina</em> <em>of Time</em> in general – we could talk for hours about the Water Temple, I’m sure! And I like that you point out Link’s journey as a big impetus for you – there’s something so fulfilling about, as you play more of the games, sort of knowing how the timeline of that game is going to play out in general, but it’s okay because you know it’s going to be pretty weird and mystical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> And there is always a setback most of the time for the hero but he always redeems himself.</p>
<p>I think about how brave Link is, that sometimes it’s almost unreal, how many people he ends up helping because of his selfless courage.</p>
<p><strong>P: That’s so true. But here is what’s weird about Link, and what you get at as a potential problem in </strong><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/06/24/if-the-hero-was-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>your poems at Cartridge Lit</strong></a><strong> – Link is sort of a blank slate character in that he doesn’t talk, doesn’t have a huge personality; rather, I feel we’re asked to place ourselves within his confines. But he’s somewhat of an anomaly, right?  Something that you point to, that I think is especially true to the <em>Zelda</em> series, is that the hero is somewhat of an anomaly – the social rules of the game world don’t necessarily apply to him – he can just walk into folks’ homes without them batting an eyelash, he can smash almost everything around him and no one says anything. I think, in general, RPGs are now recognizing and interrogating this trope (of the hero/main character functioning outside the system of rules) – but I’m interested in this idea of the anomalous character, and what it allows (or doesn’t allow) for the player. It seems like the hero is supposed to be this sort of empty sprite the player can fill in with their own narrative, but as you point out, the “universality” of the blank sprite is rarely universal, and is in fact a racialized body (here: white, male, privileged with access). Is the universal character in video games a myth? Can there be anything close to a utopic game world? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Hmmm…</p>
<p>So that is hard to determine because I feel like there hasn’t been a game where the ratio of diversity is equal, for instance I can only name maybe two or three games with main characters that are brown or black. So to ask if a utopia is possible is kind of hard because most main characters have very European features and would be what would pass for privilege, like Link, who has blonde hair and blue eyes and in some cases is referred to as a benevolent hero even when he breaks into peoples’ homes and steals their money because he has this “universally appealing look.”</p>
<p><strong>P: Exactly!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It makes sense that anyone playing a video game would want their character to look like Link’s archetype because we know in general people who look like that do in some cases have the privilege to do those actions with minimal punishment.</p>
<p><strong>P: Yea. Like for me as a white male, I don’t straightaway question Link’s behavior, what I can do in the confines of his skin, because in a way I experience reality as Link. But that’s why your work is so great, I think, and why I think it’s exciting more game narrative are paying attention to these problems. How do we disassemble these built narratives? What is it about the process of poetry, specifically, of (re)contextualizing a video game and its problems through a poem, that allows for this reworking/calling out/speaking truth?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I think video games like pieces of art can find the Waldos that society sometimes cannot, and also, I think maybe the developers want us to think about why they do certain things in video games. I think a way to dismantle these kinds of racial stigmas in games would just be, for starters, to have a main character that is a person of color. I feel, for instance, <em>Twilight Princess</em> got close to doing that because it spoke about a people who were oppressed, but once again it didn’t go into much depth and you only get to go into the twilight realm once; and though Midna claims the positives of twilight, as Link you don’t really get to experience what she’s talking about. It scratches the surface because 85% percent of that game you are only seeing twilight creatures who eat people and make everything dark.</p>
<p><strong>P: That’s so true; I remember being really surprised at the overall somberness of that game, sort of like <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, where you could maybe sense there were bigger issues just under the surface. And in <em>TP</em>, Link maybe gets to feel a bit of that oppression when he takes wolf form? Everyone is freaked out by this dangerous animal, right? Maybe I’m misremembering. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! But!</p>
<p>Though he experiences some oppression as a wolf, I don’t know if one could say he ever experiences the joys of being a wolf. Often the experience of poc is only defined by how much we suffer and not how rich our culture is. I’m thinking about how much Midna tries to explain to him why she loves the twilight, why she doesn’t see herself as cursed but as someone who loves where she is, and loves her people. I think showing a poc main character who can enjoy the adventure and shine for who they are like Link can is just as important as showing the differences in treatment and other realities.</p>
<p><strong>P: Oh, I see what you mean! I wonder if that’s a similar treatment to what Link engages in in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, which your poem, “For all the masks formed”, seems in direct conversation with: he sort of takes on all these different races for his own practical/social gain, but doesn’t actually engage them wholly – they’re all sort of confined to certain functions. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> That’s right, and it’s like, they kind of get their shine too, and they give up their powers to him&#8230;it was all such an interesting thing to think about.</p>
<p><strong>P: And the speaker, at the end of this particular poem, even mentions, “I tried to be Link, / wondering / who would have to die / for me to reincarnate into / another shade”. So, in playing the game, it seems like the gamer is somewhat implicit in this violence, as the main character, going along with the mechanics and narrative of the game. At what point, do you think, is this immersion harmful/helpful/generative? Obviously we can turn the game off and refuse to play, but why do we go along?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Hmmm…</p>
<p>‪Well it’s interesting, because as you said Link is like a blank slate&#8230;sometimes I feel that way with white culture, there are standard nationalistic things that define whiteness, but also a big part of what makes whiteness what it is, is how it can dominate others or make others inferior, and also how well it can take from others, this freedom of swapping bodies without worry, without fear. I think the immersion was great for <em>Majora’s Mask</em> but at the same time it was creepy because those main characters couldn’t be with you. You had to be them, for them.</p>
<p><strong>P: Yea, definitely, the whole game is pretty messed up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It can be but I also think it’s truly&#8230;somber. I think some themes of death are addressed well; but some things, like how Deku scrubs are treated or how they look is disturbingly offensive.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong> <strong>Earlier you mentioned some video games that center poc characters; what video games have you played / are interested in that directly or indirectly address these problems or silences of racialized bodies in built narratives? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> One game I know&#8230;doesn’t center poc per say, but instead it centers a marginalized group of people–they’re half elves and they’re oppressed because of who they are, constantly murdered and enslaved–that was Tales of <em>Symphonia</em>. As for others, my friends would know – which is sad – I want to know more!</p>
<p><strong>P: Oh, that sounds good; reminds me of the blood mages and Qunari in the <em>Dragon Age</em> games – are you familiar with that series? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I’ve heard of them but I don’t think I’ve had the chance to play them yet! But yes, it was a good game – it was deeeeep and looonngg.</p>
<p>But what would a black hero look like? That’s why I wrote my book.</p>
<p>P<strong>: Those are some of the best! And yes! That was my last question!  In your bio you mention you’re working on an upcoming poetry book, <em>if the hero of time was black</em> (</strong><a href="https://www.weaselpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Weasel Press 2018</strong></a><strong>) (which I’m so excited about, inherently) – can you talk a bit about the book? Does it expand on any of the themes and problems you bring up in these poems?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure! It does!</p>
<p>‪So when I first started this book I referred to my favorite game in the series, <em>Wind Waker</em>. In fact, here’s a picture of the cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="512" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley.jpg 384w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P: Wowowowow, that’s incredible! </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! I liked that Link the best because he wasn’t related to the hero of time but folks still considered him to be his ancestor. I think about all the black leaders before me and how we aren’t related by blood but how they are still my ancestors and they still loved me. Instead of Zelda in the background, I put Stokely Carmichael, and thanks! I had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dchante.mckenzie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my friend</a> paint it!</p>
<p>‪But anyways, I tried to go down different timelines in the series from there and envision the experience of a black hero.</p>
<p><strong>P: That sounds so rich; and with the <em>Zelda</em> series, there really are so many timelines to explore; which is another cool thing about the series, its narrative is both there and somewhat vague, open to interpretation – it’s malleable. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes!!! I had an open field.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>K. Jane Childs lives in Providence, RI, because it&#8217;s a city that appreciates weird. She is an Alabama XFA, currently studying law at Boston University. Work by K. Jane has appeared in </em>DREGINALD<em>, </em>Swarm<em>, </em>Fourth River<em>, and </em>Cartridge Lit<em>. Her favorite adventure game alter egos are Zoë Castillo and Chloe Price.</em></p>
<p><em>Her chapbook, </em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/tender-glories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tender Glories</a><em>, is a collection based on the </em>Quest for Glory <em>series of classic Sierra adventure games, and it was the winner of our Push [START] to Begin Chapbook Contest. We published it in February 2017. Below, she talks with editor William Hoffacker about marginalized characters, narrativity, representation vs. agency, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What can you tell us about the origins of your chapbook, </em>Tender Glories<em>? Why did you start writing it, and how did it begin to take shape?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>TG</em> had its origins in some reading I was doing during my MFA, specifically Kate Zambreno’s <em>Heroines</em> and Johannes Göransson’s <em>entrance to a colonial pageant in which we all begin to intricate</em>. After reading <em>Heroines, </em>I was thinking about how artificial a division between creative and scholarly work seems to me at this point in my life, and then that also led to this desire to make hybrid lyrical-narrative work that contained CNF elements. Then Ryan Bollenbach let me borrow his copy of <em>entrance</em>, and the form of that work (like a play/pageant with multiple speakers) really appealed to my little theatre-major heart. So I was kind of a method in search of a topic for a bit and then serendipitously signed up for Joel Brouwer’s Classics class (Homer, Virgil, Ovid), where we were given a prompt about writing from the perspective of marginalized characters (like Briseus). I immediately thought of the <em>Quest for Glory</em> games, and away I went. So the first draft of <em>TG</em> ended up being a project during that class.</p>
<p><strong><em>The autobiographical sections of your chapbook span a wide swath of your life—from middle school to college to divorce to motherhood—which is a welcome surprise, as I’d expect most game-based memoir to focus solely on childhood or adolescence. Did you know from the start that you wanted this project to include so many times in your life? Was it a challenge to connect all those points to the overarching lens of the </em>Quest for Glory<em> games?</em></strong></p>
<p>So, I’m 33 years old, almost 34. I grew up with computers and computer games. I’m from that shoulder generation folks call Xennials, though I prefer Generation Oregon Trail for obvious reasons. And I also struggle with the fact that narrativity is always somewhat performative for me. In other words, it doesn’t come naturally to me to try and fit my life (or my year or my day) into a Freytagian triangle or Aristotelian plot arc. I experience the urge to do that kind of shaping as a kind of external force or expectation that honestly gives me most of my anxiety. Which is a roundabout way of getting at the trouble I have answering this question. When I knew what I was doing with this project, there were moments from across my life that naturally suggested themselves as part of what I was doing. I kind of sorted my life through the sieve of the project, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong><em>Aside from the autobiographical moments, most of </em>Tender Glories<em> consists of vignettes written from the points of view of various female characters in the </em>Quest for Glory</strong><em> <strong>series. They address the hero, some questioning him, some unhappy with how they’ve been portrayed. What is it about this game series in particular that motivated you to think critically about its gender roles and representations of women? Why did these characters call out for a voice that you could provide?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m sure there are a number of game series that could be used, but this is one that I played many times over the course of my life. And all of these characters had voices, just not agency, because they weren’t playable characters. I think Roberta Williams and her team probably did a great job at the time of including so many different representations of women. It just gets back to that issue of representation vs. agency, like in some of the conversations about what’s coming out of Hollywood. I guess, in some ways, this project was a kind of close reading of the <em>QfG</em> games, or a commentated gameplay video done in text.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beyond </em>Quest for Glory<em>, describe your relationship with video games. Any other favorite games? Do you still play?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I still play! For a while it felt like the world had left point-and-click adventure games behind, but I also love the <em>Broken Sword </em>series (although the gender binary of George/Nico has really begun to feel antiquated). Recently my favorite games have been <em>Dreamfall Chapters</em> and <em>Life Is Strange</em>. I had green hair last fall as a shout-out to Chloe Price. I’m actually playing the first chapter of the follow up game, <em>Life Is Strange: Before the Storm, </em>on the weekends as a way to procrastinate outlining for my law school classes.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any genre, any scale, with no limitations), what work would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</em></strong></p>
<p>If I was adapting it, maybe something I haven’t written yet. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Otherwise, I think if Kiese Laymon ever chose to adapt <em>Long Division</em> that might be really interesting, with the time travel and the amazing characters. I just picture something like the talk-back challenges in the <em>Life Is Strange: Before the Storm </em>gameplay, but with Citoyen at the helm. Or some of Amelia Gray’s short works, as a kind of linked series of small games! Those could be really fantastic, implicating the player in the dark choices of some of her characters. IDK. Honestly, any contemporary works that are experimenting with narrativity and how you tell a story would translate really well.</p>
<p><strong><em>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</em></strong></p>
<p>Honestly, an open research memo for my legal writing class. But I’ve also got this linked collection of stories on the backburner, some of which were part of my thesis at Alabama. Hologram husbands and injectables that turn people into nixies and robot dogs that protect girlfriends from feral law students, like that. We’ll see what happens.</p>
<p><strong><em>What have you read and/or played recently that you want to recommend?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think I covered the games I’d recommend above. Holmes’s <em>The Common Law</em> is hilarious. But also: Matthew Burnside’s <em>Postludes</em>; <em>Mr. Fox</em>, by Helen Oyeyemi.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Jackson Culpepper is a graduate of the MFA program at the University of South Carolina, now living in east Tennessee. His work has appeared in </em>Armchair/Shotgun<em>, </em>decomP<em>, </em>Paper Darts<em>, and other publications.</em></p>
<p><em>His most recent story, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/bozart-cohns-don-quixote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“‘Bozart’ Cohn’s </a></em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/bozart-cohns-don-quixote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don Quixote</a><em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/bozart-cohns-don-quixote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,&#8221;</a></em><em> appeared in our  </em>Next Gen <em>Temple Issue. Below, he talks with editor William Hoffacker about Borges, economic pressure, game narratives, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>To date, </em></strong><strong>Cartridge Lit<em> has published three of your stories, all featuring “Bozart” Cohn and his chronicler. How did this series start for you? What inspired it?</em></strong></p>
<p>Initially I actually wanted to make the games, especially <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/10/10/bozart-cohns-age-tribes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Age of Tribes </em></a>and <em>Don Quixote.</em> Around the time I realized how huge of an endeavor it is to build a game I was reading Borges. In <em>Ficciones </em>there are several fictional novels that he describes, particularly showing their effects. Here, then was a model: I didn&#8217;t have to make the great game, only describe it in the same degree of complexity.</p>
<p>Another big inspiration was the work of Em Lockaby, especially his stories on the sadly defunct <em>Nightmare Mode. </em>He’s brilliant at writing about games, and influenced me greatly in how I think of them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your “Bozart” stories are fiction masquerading as journalism, like a mockumentary. What appeals to you about this framing technique? Are you drawn to it in other contexts as well?</em></strong></p>
<p>The form is an extension of the Borges idea, that of examining the complexity of a nonexistent work. Having the character Bozart be part of the story (with the narrator as foil and, as you say, chronicler) gave me the chance to imagine his ideology as he created the games.</p>
<p>There’s something to the idea that because of where we are as a culture, maybe because so many things have become monetized and advertised, that even our fiction needs to hold close to reality to matter to us. I think of Knausgaard&#8217;s <em>My Struggle</em>, which is a novel but is also exactly autobiographical.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your obsessions in your writing? What themes or subjects do you return to most?</strong></em></p>
<p>I go through phases of obsession, as I’m sure most writers do. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about economic pressure and how it forms this atmospheric weight on us, or how it can preclude some of our most basic human joys like family, meaningful work, even love. Granted, this obsession came after working a few years in retail.</p>
<p>Maybe the common denominator of my work is the question of making livable, meaningful lives for ourselves. We tend to think that’s the goal, but just how possible or achievable is it? Is it better to travel and enjoy oneself, or to devote oneself to a worthy vocation? Bozart is one of these artists who makes art solely to see what is finally possible, and that is another goal of dubious worth.</p>
<p><em><strong>Describe your personal history with video games. Any favorite games you care to mention? Do you play often?</strong></em></p>
<p>I started with <em>TIE Fighter</em>, and sleepovers with my friend and I working our way through <em>Myst</em>. <em>Wild Arms</em> for PS1 just captured my imagination when it came out. The first few Silent Hills, especially 2 of course, helped me through some dark parts of my adolescence—one day I’ll have to find a therapist who has also played it and see how that works. The narrative and exploration has always been the hook for me. Lately I’ve lost track of things; I’m no good at all at most of the console games. Still, I adored <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Life is Strange</em>, and when I have the time to devote to it, I’m looking forward to <em>The Long Dark</em>&#8216;s story mode.</p>
<p><em><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></em></p>
<p>Right now I’m working on the short story collection from which the Bozart stories come called <em>The Economic Despair Game</em>. I’ve got a solid draft and will be hunting readers soon. The collection is largely about that economic pressure/despair, with a millennial narrator on a quest for meaningful work and to make a living both. It’s also got Dragon Dice and a fair dose of Appalachian magical realism.</p>
<p><em><strong>What have you read and/or played recently that you want to recommend?</strong></em></p>
<p>Anyone who hasn’t played <em>Undertale</em> should go play it immediately. For books, <em>Night at the Fiestas</em> is an excellent short story collection from a few years ago, and Proulx&#8217;s <em>Barkskins</em> was incredible. I wish there were more of that book for me to keep reading.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Benjamin Kinney lives and writes in Marquette, Michigan, where he earned an M.A. in English from Northern Michigan University. Prior to that, he was a middle school teacher in the Tampa area. He has published reviews on the  </em>Ploughshares<em> blog and  </em>Heavy Feather Review<em>, and nonfiction in </em>Walloon Writers Review<em>. He has an infrequently updated blog at <a href="http://benjaminkinney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benjaminkinney.com</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>His story, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/words-fail-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Words Fail Him,”</a> appeared in our </em> Next Gen <em>Temple Issue. Below, he talks with editor William Hoffacker about brevity, RPGs, spending money, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Why did you choose </em></strong><strong>Chrono Trigger<em> as a subject for fiction? What special qualities does this game have that inspired your writing?</em></strong></p>
<p>From the first time I played it (and I’ve played it like fifteen times now), I cared deeply about the heroes and felt like their world was an actual place where the non-playable characters went about their lives even when I wasn’t looking. The time travel element made the world seem limitless. At the same time, the game only takes 20-30 hours to complete, and at some point the player is flying the airship around and realizing they’ve done everything they can possibly do in the game—that nothing new remains. For a game this beautiful, this realization is hard-hitting, and my piece was inspired by the desire to hang out there a little longer.</p>
<p><strong><em>I admire how many specific, world-evoking details are packed into a compact space in your piece. Do you normally work in such a short form? What are the challenges of achieving this economy of language?</em></strong></p>
<p>Aww, thanks! I tend to be long-winded, so this piece was an anomaly. In my M.A. program at Northern Michigan University, we had a lot of faculty who stressed economy of words—I took a workshop with Matthew Gavin Frank, and he could spend an hour critiquing one paragraph of an essay. NMU was where I began to always ask the question, “Is this word or sentence helping the piece?” Even though I write mostly longer stuff, my final drafts tend to be about thirty percent shorter than early drafts. My biggest fear in writing this way is that some of my voice—and even some of my message—gets lost. I want to believe that there’s a place somewhere for all my adverbs and random asides, but I’m starting to fear that there isn’t.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beyond </em></strong><strong>Chrono Trigger<em>, what is your history with video games? Any favorites you care to mention? Do you play often?</em></strong></p>
<p>Gaming was a formative part of my childhood. I have a brother who is five years older than me, and when I was in kindergarten I would sit on his bed and watch him play <em>Final Fantasy VI </em>on the Super Nintendo. I believe my early interest in RPGs is the reason I’m so interested in narratives to this day. I must have played every RPG on the Super Nintendo, and I gamed almost daily throughout high school and college. My favorite games are <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and <em>VII </em>and <em>Secret of Evermore. </em>I think about certain things differently because I played so many video games. The <em>Harvest Moon </em>games influenced how I conceptualize life in general and especially making and spending money, a topic I’m still obsessed with today. Every time I do anything even remotely adventurous, I pretend I’m Lara Croft from <em>Tomb Raider.</em> When I graduated from college, I stopped playing as often, though about one game a year still catches my interest. Just a few days ago I bought a PS4, so I might be reentering a period of playing frequently.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any genre, any scale, with no limitations), what work would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think Stephen King’s <em>Dark Tower </em>series would make an excellent RPG—it has a memorable cast of characters, a classic quest, and plenty of villains. Hell, it’s pretty similar to the <em>Wild Arms </em>games for the Playstation and PS2. I love games where I can level grind and where the main storyline never gets inundated with a bunch of side crap, so if the game fit those criteria (and if Oy was a fully playable character), I’d be happy. I haven’t seen the <em>Dark Tower </em>movie, but a lot of my friends hated it, so somebody just needs to tell Stephen King that the truest adaptation of this work is a video game!</p>
<p><strong><em>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</em></strong></p>
<p>I have a ton of new ideas that I’m always starting and then abandoning, and for the past few years I have been writing fiction and nonfiction equally. But one project that has stuck with me for about a year now is a novel about, basically, how we spend money and how that comes to define who we are. The idea was partially inspired by video games. Spending all my “leveling up” points or what have you in RPGs is always really stressful for me—what if I spend all my ability points in pursuit of becoming a self that, in retrospect, I don’t like very much? (This is an issue that plagues me in life as well. I’m gradually coming to terms with the fact that I’ll never do or own exactly what I want.)</p>
<p><strong><em>What have you read and/or played recently that you want to recommend?</em></strong></p>
<p>I reread Roberto Bolano’s <em>The Savage Detectives </em>this summer. It’s such an intricate, detailed novel, and I have a weird feeling that one of the deep truths of the universe is hidden somewhere in its pages—someone smarter than me just needs to tell me what it is. It is a great example of a work that manages to be long and complex without any part of it feeling unnecessary. A friend also turned me on to Blake Bulter’s <em>There Is No Year</em> with the promise that Butler was a lot like David Lynch (my favorite director), and I’m midway through the novel and loving it.</p>
<p>Last year I played <em>Undertale </em>on my computer, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. The world needs more great small-scale games, and <em>Undertale </em>delivers both with gameplay and story. I would say a game’s story is even more important than its gameplay, and <em>Undertale </em>seems to understand that. Also, I’ve just started <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>. It has a sense of light-heartedness and fun that the previous few installments have sadly lacked, and there is this delicious homoeroticism going on between all the male characters. And having not gamed for a while, I’m floored by how beautiful graphics are in 2017. I was used to playing my old PlayStation games and trying to figure out what half the polygons and sprites were supposed to be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Melissa Goodrich grew up in a dome on a hill in Minnesota and now calls the southwest home. She is the author of  </em>Daughters of Monsters <em>(Jellyfish Highway Press) and is at work on a collaborative collection of magical school stories. Find more at <a href="http://melissa-goodrich.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">melissa-goodrich.com</a> or  <a href="http://twitter.com/good_rib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@good_rib</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Her poem, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/stardew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Stardew,&#8221;</a> appeared in our  </em>Next Gen <em>Temple Issue</em><em>. Below, she talks with editor William Hoffacker about escapism, reincarnation, daughters, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>What is it about  </strong></em><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> <em><strong>that made you choose it as a subject for your writing? What’s special about this game that lends it well to poetry?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’ve played close to 300 hours of Stardew, and it’s because it makes me feel peaceful, cheerful, satisfied. It’s like deeply breathing. There is something serene about the soundscape, the way it feels when a day begins with rain, or you crack open a geode, or wrestle with a difficult fish. The game’s premise is escapism—in the opening sequence you see yourself at a gray cubicle amongst hundreds of grey cubicles, and you open a letter from your grandfather—and he’s willed you his Stardew farm. The game lends itself toward that fantasy of abandoning your old corporate-driven life to tend to something. To build a life upwards with the tools in your sack. I guess poems are that way too—poems are structures you build with your hands. Poems need weeding, need their geodes cracked. Poems need seasons, and magic, and rain.</p>
<p><em><strong>The poem’s speaker describes the things she wishes to do but never does, the things she does instead, things she loves, things she hopes for, things she fears, etc. The game has a player and a player-character, while the poem has an author and a speaker. How much of a divide do you perceive between the two, in both cases? When you wrote the poem, did you imagine the speaker’s desires or transcribe your own (or some of both)? When you play the game, do you act according to what you think the protagonist would do, or is the character merely your avatar in the virtual world (or some of both)?</strong></em></p>
<p>This is a great question. I love absorbing myself into the world, and letting the world absorb back into mine. I will refer (in real life) to my Stardew kids, or my escaped goats. I’ve made lists of the townspeople’s birthdays, and their favorite gifts. I’ve wondered, “Where is Leah all day? I can’t find her anywhere in the forests.” And I will feel real-me dissolve when I shear the sheep or jump down a hole in the Skull Caverns. I think there’s a mutual joy in poetry and in gaming to allow that boundary of ‘who you are’ to muddle. You are neither the speaker nor the author, and you’re both. The same thing happens as a reader—it feels like your world the whole time you’re in it, and even after you’ve left.</p>
<p><em><strong>One thing that surprised me about your poem is how the speaker’s motherhood appears only near the end, and then questions and images surrounding the daughter dominate the final two stanzas. Why did you decide that the poem should take this new turn, and how did you choose the right moment to make it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Daughters are extensions, right? So are sons, but I’m a daughter—I feel the extension of being a daughter. All of my Stardew children are daughters. I didn’t choose this. They arrived in the night. Stardew-me didn’t once swell with pregnancy, but here they were: tiny swaddled girls. I’m not sure if real-me can mother, so I’m not sure Stardew-me can either. I’ve never seen my Stardew children leave the crib. I get antsy and start a new game. It’s somehow a relief to go back to the simple cabin. One bed. One chair. A single window. A pack of parsnips. A fireplace I can light with a touch.</p>
<p>But back to extensions—there is this natural progression to extend beyond one’s life. And I felt kind of bad for my Stardew kids. They wouldn’t get the pleasure of building-from-the-ground-up. I explored the whole world already, I moved every obstacle. They wouldn’t even be strapped for cash. I felt a little like I’d robbed them of something, these pixel-kids of mine. It’s a turn in the poem because it’s a turn in my head. The world is bigger than the ‘I.’ And suddenly the ‘I’ wants to live through the extension, the daughter. And the ‘I’ can’t sense a world in which that daughter doesn’t ‘walk through her.’ It’s something I think about regarding real daughters. It’s something I think about when I’ve sunk 300 hours into a video game.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your book, </strong></em><strong>Daughters of Monsters</strong><em><strong>, is a collection of short stories, mostly of a fabulist nature, guided by a lyrical voice. If you had to adapt one of those stories into a video game, which one would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></em></p>
<p>Oooh, that’s a tough one. I think a strong contender would be “Super,” a story where a character dies repeatedly and reincarnates into different objects. I think that could make for an interesting indie game. The goal to die instead of to live. Making it tough to die. Coming back as a cabbage.  Coming back as a cigarette. A zipper. An egg. It would be weird like <em>Undertale</em>, and maybe a little sad.</p>
<p><em><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m wrapping up a collaborative collection of <a href="http://passagesnorth.com/2016/10/the-classroom-beneath-our-classroom-by-melissa-goodrich-and-dana-diehl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magical</a> <a href="http://theindianolareview.com/the-floating-away-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">school</a> <a href="http://www.theadroitjournal.org/issue-twenty-one-dana-diehl-melissa-goodrich-the-adroit-journal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stories</a> with the phenomenal Dana Diehl. Seriously, she’s like my favorite living writer. Working with her on this project is so liberating and joy-filled. I adore the stories we make together, as we build on one another’s strengths and instincts and obsessions with being in school. I’m not sure what comes after that.</p>
<p><em><strong>What have you read recently that you’d like to recommend?</strong></em></p>
<p>Roxane Gay’s <em>Hunger</em>, which was absolutely powerful and important. <em>The House of the Scorpion</em> was awesome. Zach Doss’s short story <a href="https://www.puertodelsol.org/single-post/2017/07/26/Bespoke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Bespoke”</a> (and all of Zach Doss’ boyfriend stories, really). Any poems that pop up on my Twitter feed (I recommend reading all the poems). And I’m re-reading <em>The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake</em> and figuring out how fabulists become novelists, so if you (like me) are terrified of novel-writing, might be Step 1.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Elizabeth Deanna Morris Lakes was born in Harrisburg, PA and has a BA in Creative Writing from Susquehanna University and an MFA from George Mason University. She has appeared or is forthcoming in </em>Crab Fat Magazine<em>, </em>The Birds We Piled Loosely<em>, </em>SmokeLong Quarterly<em>, </em>cahoodaloodaling<em>, and </em>Mom Egg Review<em>. She has a chapbook, </em>Patterning<em>, from Corgi Snorkel Press.</em></p>
<p><em>Elizabeth&#8217;s essay, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/green-gamer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Green Gamer,&#8221;</a> appeared in our </em>Next Gen<em> Temple Issue. Below, she talks with editor William Hoffacker about revision, podcasts, Stephen King, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How did this essay begin to take form in your mind? Was there an inciting incident (like, say the conversation in the final scene)? Had you been mentally wrestling with these questions about your relationship with games for long before you started writing the essay?</strong></em></p>
<p>In my old age (I’m 28.5 years old), I have started finally writing the “final drafts” of things I’ve been trying to write for a long time. Last year, I got a flash fiction piece called <a href="http://www.smokelong.com/consequence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Consequence”</a> published about a woman who loses a baby. I’ve written maybe 15 poems about the same subject. I wrote two drafts of “Consequence” itself before it was published, but really, every other poem before that was an earlier “draft.”</p>
<p>I haven’t tried to write about video games before, but I have been wrestling with it a lot. This sort of came to a head when I was talking to Alyse Knorr when <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>came out. She had suggested I should pitch a book, since Boss Fight’s authors are largely male. Ideally, I’d want to write a book about <em>Silent Hill 3</em>. The game deals a lot with violence, the human condition, and birth—all things that I write about a lot. But I have only ever watched my husband, Kenny, play this game, and absolutely could not play it myself—it’s technically difficult <em>and</em> scary. I thought maybe I could co-write it with Kenny—he’s the trivia expert on Silent Hill and has the symbol that’s used as the save spot for a tattoo—and I’d come at it from the philosophical standpoint. When I pitched my idea to Kenny, his very first reaction was, “You’d have to play through it. I insist.” And so I got stuck. Kenny was basically saying I’d have to “earn” my right to talk about this game. But I felt like I, too, had suffered through it. Kenny made me watch him play it <em>in the dark!</em></p>
<p>Finally, these conversations with my coworkers pushed me over. I wrote the essay.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mostly you have written poetry, as well as some short fiction. This essay represents your entry into a new frontier of creative nonfiction. How does your writing process differ (if at all) from one genre to another? Do you have to employ different skills, or access different parts of your brain (so to speak), when writing prose rather than poetry?</strong></em></p>
<p>I had a few reasons for abandoning prose for most of my formal schooling, but the most practical was that I get very overwhelmed when I have to revise something that I can’t see all of at once. The way I cheat with this is two-fold: most of my poems are part of longer series (and thus bleed into the long-form of most prose) and all of my prose is modular. Did I just give something away? Sorry! Everything is in sections. Everything is compartmentalized. Then, I can write everything in blocks and rearrange them like you might rearrange the order you have pictures hung on a wall.</p>
<p>Also, podcasts. I listen to a lot of podcasts. Like a LOT: sometimes 3 hours a day. Listening to podcasts helped me unlock something in my brain in terms of the way I write prose now. When I write prose now, I imagine I’m talking on a podcast.</p>
<p><em><strong>In your essay, you write about the reasons why </strong></em><strong>Pokémon Blue</strong><em><strong> is the only game you’ve ever beaten. Have you tried playing any other turn-based role playing games? Besides the obvious (Zelda games), are there any other game genres in which you’ve found any success or particular enjoyment?</strong></em></p>
<p>So, this section was a lot longer originally in the essay, and Kenny helped me cut it down. There is one other game genre in which I’ve won: point-and-click adventure games. Specifically <em>The Curse of Monkey Island</em> and <em>Escape from Monkey Island. </em>I have beaten those games, but I didn’t count them because they are so linear. There’s only one way to beat them. The first two Pokémon games have 150 Pokémon you can use to fight the different gym leaders and trainers. Point-and-click games have solutions—solutions that I could have, if I wanted, googled.</p>
<p>Kenny would also like me to point out that I did play a <em>lot</em> of <em>Skyrim</em>. I had watched him play through the main campaign when I started <em>Skyrim</em>, and so I picked it up later and played a lot of the sort of “main sidequests” that he hadn’t done. I liked that game because I could sneak—I would literally sneak my entire way to different new locations, even though it was slower, just to get my stat up—and so I could oftentimes take out entire mini-dungeons at a distance with my bow and arrow. Kenny and I have also played through a fairly large portion of <em>Resident Evil 5</em> together: I tend to, not so surprisingly, use the sniper from the high ground while he attacked enemies up close. Oh, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>. But guess what I avoided for as long as possible? THE MINE (<em>i.e.</em>, the only place where you have to fight anything).</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could create a video game (of any type, any scale, no limitations) based on any work of literature, what work would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have been reading and re-reading a lot of children’s books recently (for no reason (I’m kidding; I have a baby)) and will give two short answers related to that and one long one.</p>
<p><em>Harold and the Purple Crayon</em> where you could draw things and have you interact with them, but in the boundless way Harold does (I realize a game like <em>Scribblenauts</em> has similarly tried to create this).</p>
<p><em>Corduroy</em>. I have very little conception of this, except that I love the idea of roaming around a department store at night as a cozy bear. Also, in terms of a “game”—Corduroy never does find his button! And so a game where there’s not really a way to “win” would be great. I’ve also dressed up as Corduroy for Halloween. Also, that second to last page, when she says, “I like you the way you are, but you’ll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened,” makes me weep every time.</p>
<p>Finally, if <em>The Dark Tower</em> series could be a game, that would be amazing. I’m talking about a full-fledged, seven-part game, like the books, with all deviations and explorations. Kenny has read me those books out loud, and I think my favorite part about them is that for “gunslingers” there’s remarkably little shooting. Most of it is travel, exploration, and problem solving. If I could have a game with the richness of those settings, the character development, and the puzzles, I would play that game to its credits.</p>
<p><em><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have written half a book’s worth of poems about brassica/two women who live on a farm. I have my thesis, which is in two parts, Part 1: Ashley Sugarnotch and the Wolf and Part 2: The Rest of Us. I have an essay on touch. I am trying to figure out how these things go together and should exist in the world. I think I have more brassica poems in me. I feel like I have a book in there somewhere, but I don’t know where yet!</p>
<p><em><strong>What have you read recently that you’d like to recommend?</strong></em></p>
<p>I just finished the current collections of <em>The Wicked and the Divine</em> and really enjoyed that. Kenny is currently reading me the eighth book (or installment 4.5) of the <em>Dark Tower</em> series and just finished reading me <em>It</em>. Also, if anyone else tells me that clown is creepy, I’m gonna start yelling. The scariest thing in that book is the intense loneliness of the children. I don’t think I’ve ever wept as hard at a book as I have at the initial introduction to Ben Hanscom. I’m reading Kenny <em>Little House on the Banks of Plum Creek </em>and also <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>. I’m also slowly reading <em>The Desires of Mothers to Please Others in Letters</em> by Bernadette Mayer. I guess none of those are poetry…whoops!</p>
