								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If writing a thoughtful, thorough, stimulating nonfiction book about a video game sounds like a challenge, then choosing <em>Kingdom Hearts II </em>as the subject of such a book must be performing that task on Expert mode. The Kingdom Hearts series of games consists of several more spin-offs and prequels (e.g., <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</em>, etc.) than “core” titles. To learn the complicated lore seems almost impossible. Not only is there a great quantity of games and characters therein, but their stories are mysterious, confusing, and vague, even intentionally so. As quoted in this new title from Boss Fight Books, director Tetsuya Nomura has stated, “Whether it’s game, anime, or manga, there should be a place where you can speculate things. I feel that way, so I wanted to make a game that gives space for your imagination. That’s why I don’t like revealing everything and saying, ‘This is the answer.’” So how does one write the book on one game in a series whose creator takes pride in weaving intricate narratives that are full to bursting with the unexplained?</p>
<p>Despite this high degree of difficulty, <a href="https://bossfightbooks.com/products/kingdom-hearts-ii-by-alexa-ray-corriea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Kingdom Hearts II  </em>author Alexa Ray Corriea</a> describes the game in such a lucid way that even a neophyte will understand and appreciate her summaries of the plot and analysis of the characters. While a lesser writer might have gotten bogged down in the minutiae of the game’s many worlds, mechanics, and supporting cast, Corriea deftly distills the sprawling story into just the essential details that the reader need know in order to grasp the context surrounding her deep dives into the game’s finer points. Readers who haven’t played <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> (and even those who have, who can be forgiven for forgetting some things in the twelve years since this game’s release) will receive a helpful primer on its heroes and villains (and all the shades of gray in between), but a modest one in service of what’s really important here: Corriea’s dissection of the game’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>While similar titles might take the reader chronologically through a game’s story, <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> emphasizes theme and subject matter in the organization of its ideas. Each chapter reads like a standalone essay in which Corriea examines a new aspect of the game, or the game as a whole from a new angle. In “Gone Girl,” she looks at the game through a feminist lens, magnifying the shortcomings of the one-dimensional female “lead,” Kairi, while elevating the virtues of the more complex Naminé. In “Bad Romances and Rad Bromances,” Corriea challenges the perceived significance of the romance between Kairi and protagonist Sora, while making a persuasive case that the much more important relationship is the homosocial one between Sora and best friend Riku. In “Riku and Redemption, or, What Doesn’t Kill You,” she uses the subplot of the tortured anti-hero to tackle universal questions about what makes a good person and the dichotomy of light and darkness in all of us.</p>
<p>Beyond the profundity of these close readings of <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>, Corriea also grabs the reader by revealing her personal attachment to the game series. In the prologue, she describes her relationship with her younger brothers, Raymond, who underwent many treatments for achondroplasia throughout childhood, and Jake, who was unexpectedly born ten years after her. The first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>game united these three siblings, disparate in age, as she writes: “When the game ended, we all cried, watching Riku shut himself behind the large white door to the dark realm and watching Sora float away into the surrounding blackness. We talked about how the game made us realize we would always be okay if we had each other’s backs.” In the chapter about learning from Riku, Corriea also pays tribute to her own best friend, saying, “Christilynn and I were inseparable in the little fantasy worlds we built for ourselves, and we dove into Kingdom Hearts with gusto.” These moments of insight into the author’s life help to raise the emotional stakes for readers, as we come to see the game as not only a cultural artifact but also a formative experience.</p>
<p>Much like the <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>games themselves, Corriea’s <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> finds power in hybridity, blending personal essay with intellectual critique. Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is how it honors its subject without being precious about it. The author does not allow nostalgia to cloud her judgment. Instead, she casts an unflinching gaze at the flaws in <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Hearts II</em>, especially in the chapter that covers the game’s notorious first few hours of playing as new character Roxas. Corriea scrutinizes this section of the game and its infamy early on in her book, thus setting a precedent that she will fairly assess the game’s shortcomings rather than merely singing its praises. With anticipation and hype for <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> currently escalating, now is the perfect moment to reflect on the franchise’s history, and Corriea’s <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em> provides that backward look with both well-earned pathos and scholarly rigor.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samus Aran, the female protagonist of Nintendo’s <i>Metroid</i> series, has known and encountered countless deaths on the alien planet Zebes. In Owen Vince’s chapbook, <i><a href="http://fathombooks.org/html/vince.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Adrift of Samus Aran</a>, </i>planet and body meet in the formlessness of death, and something entirely new emerges.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">ZEBES has entered</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">our bodies</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">as Dirt                    Enters</p>
<p style="padding-left: 180px;">our bodies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">i want to be nothing more</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">than Dirt, entering</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">a body</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">[ as ] myriad ways beneath</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">the planet’s</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">arm ;</p>
<p>In a series of fifteen sparse poems that flit across the page like half-remembered meditations, Vince’s speaker visits the psychic remnants of their life, the intersections and edges of their experience within a landscape that has turned them into “a / Body rounded / to Zero.” The speaker comes to understand their body as a sort of aftershock of trauma, that “i am carrying what / remains / of sense, deft logic” and questioning: “What of skin that fills an entire sub-subterranean / cavern   What of that?”</p>
<p>The problem of the mutated and cumulative body seems a critical thread in this short collection, as Vince’s speaker grapples as a scientist would with the realities and mysteries of their physical and spiritual existence. The <i>Metroid </i>games (pre-<i>Prime</i> series) take place in a 2D space, with the world laid out in four directions (up, down, left, right). Samus Aran, however, is able to move diagonally through the world as well, thus expanding her navigational possibilities to eight directions. Vince seems to take this game mechanic and explore its affective implications—this human aberration on an alien planet. In one poem, the speaker steps into an observational role to wonder at “the manner in which you under / penetrate the coherence of this – corpus, pale golden / hair under your arm.” As a glitch in the logic of Zebes, the speaker is able to conclude:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">on Zebes i would die</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">in Eight directions – on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">Zebes i would ascertain</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">that death is a program</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">insufficient</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">to complete the program</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">it describes ;</p>
<p>Perhaps the glitch is the human body itself and its desires. Though the body suffuses the text, it is mostly in strange amalgamations of terrain (“the smashed / oesophagus / of the Glacier”). Perhaps the most purely human anatomy within the text is the speaker’s hands, which can be traced in stages of being clasped, unclasped, “unbound, and so careless they just hang there.” If the hands can function as a stand-in for the body, then it is not until the speaker has psychically removed themselves (“the undersides of the hands / are far below me”) that they are able to become “lost in the highways / of the Landscape” and reach a point “where you will say, ‘I am done.’”</p>
<p>In <i>The Adrift of Samus Aran, </i>Vince’s speaker slowly dissolves into the landscape where they have met with death and the multiplicities of self. By the end of the chapbook, the “I” has nearly disappeared and this reader is left with an image:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">often,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">the woman will climb</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">into the window</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">until her body is no longer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px;">framed by it ;</p>
<p>Here is an artist who disassembles the framework of the video game and organically mixes virtual landscape, character, and body to explore death as a means of dispersal and contamination in line with a necropastoral poetics. Owen Vince’s collection can easily be read in one sitting, yet I found myself coming back to it again and again, wanting to float with its speaker through their strange world and sift through the ruined intersections between poetry and video game.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new literary review site <em>Piece Meal Reviews</em> has a review of Thomas Nowak&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2014/05/19/flashcards/" title="Flashcards" target="_blank">Flashcards</a>&#8221; <a href="http://piecemealreviews.com/2014/10/06/flashcards-by-thomas-nowak/#more-199" target="_blank">up on their site now</a>.</p>
<p>Some good bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Before reading it aloud to my boyfriend, I felt compelled to explain the format: Each poem is a rectangular block cropped to size and divided into two “sides” with a double forward slash. I wasn’t sure how to convey this, so we agreed that I should say “flip” when I came to the division.</em></p>
<p><em>Based purely on poetic merit, each “back” section could stand as a piece of writing on its own. Subtle wordplay in “GLHF” (such as the warm vowel sounds linking “someone,” “rolls,” and “tongue,” or the nearly equidistant spacing between the three “s” words) creates an affecting rhythm and continuity. Combined with the niche subject of gaming, Nowak’s work inevitably raises the issue of knowledge and contextualization of subject matter for artistic purposes.</em></p>
<p><em>The familiar simplicity of flashcards as a learning tool lends an appealingly prosaic touch, and in a way that avoids dryness or too stark a constrast with the second parts of the poems.</em></p>
</blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>A note: This isn’t really a review, so to speak, because the idea of writing a legitimate review is terrifying to me. This is more “thoughts on” rather than “meaningful criticism.” We’re all talking about video games, here, so there has to be at least a little room for just having fun with things.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> * * *</p>
<p>Unlike Michael P. Williams, author of <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/collections/books/products/chrono-trigger-by-michael-p-williams" target="_blank"><i>Chrono Trigger</i></a> (not the game, but the book, out now from <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/" target="_blank">Boss Fight Books</a>), I did not buy myself, or have someone buy for me, the Super Nintendo game of the same title. At the time the game was released, I had no video game systems to speak of, but a few friends did, and a few friends’ older brothers did go out and buy the exorbitantly-priced game with their allowances, which meant I was able to watch the game from a spectator’s seat between slices of pizza and Coke and skateboarding sessions out in the driveway.</p>
<p>In a way, I beat the game before ever guiding Crono a single step.</p>
<p>I bought my SNES and a handful of games—<i>Chrono Trigger</i>, <i>Final Fantasy VI</i>, and <i>Earthbound</i>, the three games that many would say are the <i>magnum opi</i> of the 16-bit—for what I think was about sixty dollars. I bought it from one of those friends&#8217; older brothers, who said selling the system and those games was like “losing a friend.” But, apparently money was more important — so that he could buy a PlayStation, no doubt.</p>
<p>Unlike Williams, I had no magical experience, as Williams did, upon unsealing the game and turning on its power for the first time. I simply pulled mine from that cardboard box—the gray plastic already a little yellowed, the label&#8217;s edges frayed. I had no strategy guide, but I’d already spectated my way through the dungeons and key sequences. More than once heard my eight-year-old friends shout, “I did hit <i>L-A-R-A</i>, damn it!” I knew what I was doing. I was ready.</p>
<p>I always felt that my early experiences with <i>Chrono Trigger</i> were akin to watching the director’s commentary on a movie before watching the movie itself. I always felt that knowledge helped me understand the game better than my peers. But the delight in Williams’ new book is what I think of as the behind-the-scenes of that director’s commentary—insights on the game’s production in an angle that is uniquely his.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> * * *</p>
<p><i>Chrono Trigger</i> is the second book in a series of video game-related books from Boss Fight Books. The first, <a href="http://bossfightbooks.com/collections/books/products/earthbound-by-ken-baumann" target="_blank"><i>EarthBound</i></a>, by Ken Baumann, is divided into three &#8220;narratives&#8221;: reminiscing of playing the game with his older brother, a present-time replaying that coincides with a major illness, and general criticism. Williams takes a slightly different approach, favoring mostly criticism laced with his perspective on Japanese culture, race, sexuality, gender issues, and apocalypse.</p>
<p>Williams recounts his own time as a teacher at a Japanese school, and how largely strange and unique he was to the students. Japan, as he says, is largely a one-race country—although supposedly 1.5% of the nation is non-Japanese—and the world of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is very much the same, populated by “one global monorace, spanning all the way from prehistory to the dismal future of 2300 A.D.” That sense of Williams&#8217; otherness bleeds throughout the book, and reflects well in his criticism.</p>
<p>It turns out that the &#8220;monorace&#8221; decision was largely based on a desire for “an aesthetic commonly called <i>mukokuseki</i>, or ‘nationalitilessness.’” Essentially, a desire to remove Japanese cultural distinctions from games that would be sold on an international level. This helped to both make characters more “relatable” to Western audiences and prevent anything that might be seen as racially insensitive. Interlacing his own experiences as the “other” within that country, Williams starts to hit his stride, parsing Japanese history for reasons why the game’s designers made such exclusive decisions.</p>
<p>Williams handles gender and sexuality with the same type of appropriate and insightful balance between analysis of Japanese cultural norms and his own experiences as a gay man who was repeatedly interrogated by his students: “‘<i>Kanojo imasu ka?”’ Are you married? Do you have a girlfriend?”</i> For a culture so seemingly heteronormative, Williams points out that <i>Chrono Trigger</i> actually does a great deal of interesting things with gender and sexuality that my less-than-ten-year-old brain certainly didn’t process as spectator <i>or</i> player.</p>
<p>Crono and Marle are the standard straight white couple, yes, but there’s also some truly interesting analysis into Lucca’s possible <i>robosexual-ness</i>, and the fact that Frog might hold a closeted love for Cyrus behind all his <i>thy</i>s and <i>thou</i>s. Does Magnus have an insestual love toward his sister, Schala?</p>
<p>And what about Magus’ general Flea, who is identified repeatedly as male, but dresses as a woman, and attacks by kissing? Is one of Flea&#8217;s bits of dialog—“Male or female, what difference does it make? Power is beautiful, and I’ve got the power.”—a “queer anthem,” as Williams calls it? To help answer some of these questions, Williams brings in his knowledge of the complexities of the Japanese language, which, for example, has nearly a dozen options in pronouns. Flea uses <i>atai</i> whereas Frog uses <i>ore</i>, two male-oriented pronouns that have different, nuanced definitions to Japanese speakers. Naturally, that meaningful difference is rendered down into a single “he” in the American version. But if one were to play the game again, knowing this possibility, what new readings might they make from Flea&#8217;s attacks, or Frog&#8217;s regrets?</p>
<p>All of this is to say the book’s strongest point is analyzing the <i>what if</i>. The ways the game is very different between its Japanese and American incarnations, and the many ways they could have diverged still, given simple choices by the game’s translators. The ways Americans might reinvest themselves in the game if only they knew the nuances lost in translation.</p>
<p>And on those translations — the two interviews Williams has integrated into the book, the first with Ted Woolsey, the original translator for the SNES version, and the second with Tom Slattery, who translated the Nintendo DS version, are both remarkably compelling. Everything from impossible deadlines to boring cubicles to accidentally gendering a character that had been ambiguous for years—they prove just how difficult it is to carry all those nuances over from one side of the world to another. It&#8217;s sort of like time travel in the game itself—things get lost along the way, or skewed, and sometimes, it just doesn&#8217;t make all that much sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> * * *</p>
<p>The book did meander a bit, in my opinion, which kept me from truly engaging within its first 40 or so pages. At times it felt a little like a dungeon that was designed purposefully to confuse the player (reader) into taking wrong turns, circumnavigating through hallways already explored. I wondered at times if it wouldn’t have benefited from a little more insight from Williams’ unique perspective on Japanese culture rather than lengthy critiques of how the game’s time travel paradoxes don’t often make sense—as I said before, does time travel ever truly make sense?</p>
<p>And I’d hardly recommend the book to someone who wasn’t already familiar with Crono and his world-saving, Lavos-killing friends, although I don’t think Williams and Boss Fight Books are looking to publish books of generally-accessible criticism. This book is for gamers, those who grew up on the heyday of JRPGs, who hold dear places in their hearts for these 16-bit games. <i>Chrono Trigger</i> is a book, then, for those who want an excuse to play the game yet again. To dig up an old dusted-out cartridge or to scan some illegitimate-looking site for a ROM. To shell out a few bucks to play it on a smartphone or on a Nintendo DS.</p>
<p>In that light, the book definitely succeeds. The book makes me want to dig for the box I know contains my copy of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> and all its siblings. Makes me want to remember how to connect a Super Nintendo to a modern-day TV (the RF/antenna connector still works but remember how much you hate screwing them in!). Makes me want to slog through the first few hours of the game, which I’ve inevitably played more times than I can count, in order to find the gems I’ve forgotten.</p>
<p>Armed, then, to see the game differently. To consider Lucca’s sexuality, or the meaning of Crono&#8217;s silence and how that reflects on the game&#8217;s standard straight relationship with Marle. To think about the events that have happened between 1995 and today that some might think of as apocalyptic, and how that changes the tragedy of 1999 A.D. To think about the quirks in translation—do you know what the “Naga-ette Bromide” <i>really</i> is?—and to consider why the game’s creators made some characters men, and others women, and others between. To be a completely different kind of spectator.</p>
<p>Isn’t that what these books are all about? To not only remind us of why we love these games, and make us want to play them, but also to render them new again?</p>
