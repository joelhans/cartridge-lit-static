								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara &amp; I meet at the mayor’s tiny house to salvage the gleaming green rupees scattered across his lawn among the stones &amp; shrubbery. Today, like every day since birth, we wear matching green tunics &amp; chug milk out of mason jars to strengthen our shield-arms. Our rusted swords dice the No Trespassing signpost &amp;, with a running start, I somersault into the hedges, stuffing emerald gems into my wallet, while Sara smashes the artisanal clay vases on his porch. When I roll spine-first into an oak tree, her giggles crescendo into a shriek until she sounds like a domestic hen pierced by a flaming arrow. The purple maw of a flower resembling a giant Venus flytrap clamps down on Sara’s boot, so I charge in circles waving my blade at the wind, oak shield brandished from a ten-foot distance. She severs the mutant plant’s stalk &amp;, to celebrate our success, I detonate a homemade bomb that pulverizes a boulder then declare myself Guardian of the Wood. Sara slingshots an acorn that pegs my forehead &amp; points to her assailant’s stem slashed at the root. She waits for me to piece a vase back together, fill it with water, &amp; carry it home.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ashley Harris is an Aquarius that aspires to be both a physician and poet. She attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the Johnston Scholarship, a four-year scholarship based on merit. She graduated in 2015 with a double major in Chemistry and Hispanic Culture and Literature with a minor in Creative Writing. Her lifelong goal has been to be able to translate and create bilingual work and in May 2015 she began that journey by publishing a short story entitled “Black Wall Street” in both Spanish and English in an online magazine entitled </em>Aguas de Pozos<em>. After graduation, she won the Gerard Unk Fellowship Grant to travel to both London and Portobelo, Panama to study the poetry and art between the two locations. In addition, she helped Dr. Renee Alexander-Craft with her studies on the Carnaval tradition in Portobelo through the online database </em>Digital Portobelo<em>.</em><em> She has also published her work in journals such as </em>Event Horizon<em>, </em>Wusgood.black<em> </em><em>and the </em>Yellow Chair Review<em>. She has an upcoming poetry book called “If the hero of time was black” that will be published through Weasel Press in Spring 2018. Ashley is currently emerged in clinical research, poetry, and the legend of Zelda. Her Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/alchemistnegra?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@alchemistnegra</a>, her Instagram is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashleyalanpoe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ashleyalanpoe</a>, and her Facebook fan page is  <a href="http://fb.me/alchemistnegra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fb.me/alchemistnegra</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ashley Harris’ </em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/06/24/if-the-hero-was-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>poems</em></a><em> are featured in our current issue, </em><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/issue-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The </em>Next Gen<em> Temple Issue</em></a><em>. I recently sat down with Ashley via Google Hangout to chat about her work with </em>The Legend of Zelda<em> series and her thoughts on racialized bodies in video games. </em></p>
<p><strong>Phil: So, can you tell me a bit about your history and relationship with the <em>Zelda</em> series? What brought you to it? What makes it an especially complex subject for you, as opposed to similar games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ashley:</strong> Well that’s a great question! I was introduced to <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> when I was probably 12 years old by playing my little cousin’s Nintendo 64, and I remember we could never get past the Deku Tree level because there were spiders with skulls on their backs and we thought that was scary, but then one day I was provoked to finish it by my older guy cousin because he said that I was too girly to play such a game, then when I finished it I fell in love with the story, and I continued buying more <em>Zelda</em> games because the story of the hero coming from the woods and becoming a legend was inspiring, it’s what I’ve used to push myself in times of hardship. Also, other games don’t have the timeline, characters or rich history that each <em>Zelda</em> game has.</p>
<p><strong>P: Yea! The Deku tree is notoriously tough, and <em>Ocarina</em> <em>of Time</em> in general – we could talk for hours about the Water Temple, I’m sure! And I like that you point out Link’s journey as a big impetus for you – there’s something so fulfilling about, as you play more of the games, sort of knowing how the timeline of that game is going to play out in general, but it’s okay because you know it’s going to be pretty weird and mystical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> And there is always a setback most of the time for the hero but he always redeems himself.</p>
<p>I think about how brave Link is, that sometimes it’s almost unreal, how many people he ends up helping because of his selfless courage.</p>
<p><strong>P: That’s so true. But here is what’s weird about Link, and what you get at as a potential problem in </strong><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/06/24/if-the-hero-was-black/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>your poems at Cartridge Lit</strong></a><strong> – Link is sort of a blank slate character in that he doesn’t talk, doesn’t have a huge personality; rather, I feel we’re asked to place ourselves within his confines. But he’s somewhat of an anomaly, right?  Something that you point to, that I think is especially true to the <em>Zelda</em> series, is that the hero is somewhat of an anomaly – the social rules of the game world don’t necessarily apply to him – he can just walk into folks’ homes without them batting an eyelash, he can smash almost everything around him and no one says anything. I think, in general, RPGs are now recognizing and interrogating this trope (of the hero/main character functioning outside the system of rules) – but I’m interested in this idea of the anomalous character, and what it allows (or doesn’t allow) for the player. It seems like the hero is supposed to be this sort of empty sprite the player can fill in with their own narrative, but as you point out, the “universality” of the blank sprite is rarely universal, and is in fact a racialized body (here: white, male, privileged with access). Is the universal character in video games a myth? Can there be anything close to a utopic game world? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Hmmm…</p>
<p>So that is hard to determine because I feel like there hasn’t been a game where the ratio of diversity is equal, for instance I can only name maybe two or three games with main characters that are brown or black. So to ask if a utopia is possible is kind of hard because most main characters have very European features and would be what would pass for privilege, like Link, who has blonde hair and blue eyes and in some cases is referred to as a benevolent hero even when he breaks into peoples’ homes and steals their money because he has this “universally appealing look.”</p>
<p><strong>P: Exactly!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It makes sense that anyone playing a video game would want their character to look like Link’s archetype because we know in general people who look like that do in some cases have the privilege to do those actions with minimal punishment.</p>
<p><strong>P: Yea. Like for me as a white male, I don’t straightaway question Link’s behavior, what I can do in the confines of his skin, because in a way I experience reality as Link. But that’s why your work is so great, I think, and why I think it’s exciting more game narrative are paying attention to these problems. How do we disassemble these built narratives? What is it about the process of poetry, specifically, of (re)contextualizing a video game and its problems through a poem, that allows for this reworking/calling out/speaking truth?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I think video games like pieces of art can find the Waldos that society sometimes cannot, and also, I think maybe the developers want us to think about why they do certain things in video games. I think a way to dismantle these kinds of racial stigmas in games would just be, for starters, to have a main character that is a person of color. I feel, for instance, <em>Twilight Princess</em> got close to doing that because it spoke about a people who were oppressed, but once again it didn’t go into much depth and you only get to go into the twilight realm once; and though Midna claims the positives of twilight, as Link you don’t really get to experience what she’s talking about. It scratches the surface because 85% percent of that game you are only seeing twilight creatures who eat people and make everything dark.</p>
<p><strong>P: That’s so true; I remember being really surprised at the overall somberness of that game, sort of like <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, where you could maybe sense there were bigger issues just under the surface. And in <em>TP</em>, Link maybe gets to feel a bit of that oppression when he takes wolf form? Everyone is freaked out by this dangerous animal, right? Maybe I’m misremembering. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! But!</p>
<p>Though he experiences some oppression as a wolf, I don’t know if one could say he ever experiences the joys of being a wolf. Often the experience of poc is only defined by how much we suffer and not how rich our culture is. I’m thinking about how much Midna tries to explain to him why she loves the twilight, why she doesn’t see herself as cursed but as someone who loves where she is, and loves her people. I think showing a poc main character who can enjoy the adventure and shine for who they are like Link can is just as important as showing the differences in treatment and other realities.</p>
<p><strong>P: Oh, I see what you mean! I wonder if that’s a similar treatment to what Link engages in in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, which your poem, “For all the masks formed”, seems in direct conversation with: he sort of takes on all these different races for his own practical/social gain, but doesn’t actually engage them wholly – they’re all sort of confined to certain functions. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> That’s right, and it’s like, they kind of get their shine too, and they give up their powers to him&#8230;it was all such an interesting thing to think about.</p>
<p><strong>P: And the speaker, at the end of this particular poem, even mentions, “I tried to be Link, / wondering / who would have to die / for me to reincarnate into / another shade”. So, in playing the game, it seems like the gamer is somewhat implicit in this violence, as the main character, going along with the mechanics and narrative of the game. At what point, do you think, is this immersion harmful/helpful/generative? Obviously we can turn the game off and refuse to play, but why do we go along?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Hmmm…</p>
<p>‪Well it’s interesting, because as you said Link is like a blank slate&#8230;sometimes I feel that way with white culture, there are standard nationalistic things that define whiteness, but also a big part of what makes whiteness what it is, is how it can dominate others or make others inferior, and also how well it can take from others, this freedom of swapping bodies without worry, without fear. I think the immersion was great for <em>Majora’s Mask</em> but at the same time it was creepy because those main characters couldn’t be with you. You had to be them, for them.</p>
<p><strong>P: Yea, definitely, the whole game is pretty messed up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It can be but I also think it’s truly&#8230;somber. I think some themes of death are addressed well; but some things, like how Deku scrubs are treated or how they look is disturbingly offensive.</p>
<p><strong>P:</strong> <strong>Earlier you mentioned some video games that center poc characters; what video games have you played / are interested in that directly or indirectly address these problems or silences of racialized bodies in built narratives? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> One game I know&#8230;doesn’t center poc per say, but instead it centers a marginalized group of people–they’re half elves and they’re oppressed because of who they are, constantly murdered and enslaved–that was Tales of <em>Symphonia</em>. As for others, my friends would know – which is sad – I want to know more!</p>
<p><strong>P: Oh, that sounds good; reminds me of the blood mages and Qunari in the <em>Dragon Age</em> games – are you familiar with that series? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I’ve heard of them but I don’t think I’ve had the chance to play them yet! But yes, it was a good game – it was deeeeep and looonngg.</p>
<p>But what would a black hero look like? That’s why I wrote my book.</p>
<p>P<strong>: Those are some of the best! And yes! That was my last question!  In your bio you mention you’re working on an upcoming poetry book, <em>if the hero of time was black</em> (</strong><a href="https://www.weaselpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Weasel Press 2018</strong></a><strong>) (which I’m so excited about, inherently) – can you talk a bit about the book? Does it expand on any of the themes and problems you bring up in these poems?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure! It does!</p>
<p>‪So when I first started this book I referred to my favorite game in the series, <em>Wind Waker</em>. In fact, here’s a picture of the cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2290" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="512" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley.jpg 384w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ashley-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P: Wowowowow, that’s incredible! </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! I liked that Link the best because he wasn’t related to the hero of time but folks still considered him to be his ancestor. I think about all the black leaders before me and how we aren’t related by blood but how they are still my ancestors and they still loved me. Instead of Zelda in the background, I put Stokely Carmichael, and thanks! I had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dchante.mckenzie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my friend</a> paint it!</p>
<p>‪But anyways, I tried to go down different timelines in the series from there and envision the experience of a black hero.</p>
<p><strong>P: That sounds so rich; and with the <em>Zelda</em> series, there really are so many timelines to explore; which is another cool thing about the series, its narrative is both there and somewhat vague, open to interpretation – it’s malleable. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes!!! I had an open field.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Elizabeth Deanna Morris Lakes was born in Harrisburg, PA and has a BA in Creative Writing from Susquehanna University and an MFA from George Mason University. She has appeared or is forthcoming in </em>Crab Fat Magazine<em>, </em>The Birds We Piled Loosely<em>, </em>SmokeLong Quarterly<em>, </em>cahoodaloodaling<em>, and </em>Mom Egg Review<em>. She has a chapbook, </em>Patterning<em>, from Corgi Snorkel Press.</em></p>
<p><em>Elizabeth&#8217;s essay, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2017/07/07/green-gamer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Green Gamer,&#8221;</a> appeared in our </em>Next Gen<em> Temple Issue. Below, she talks with editor William Hoffacker about revision, podcasts, Stephen King, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>How did this essay begin to take form in your mind? Was there an inciting incident (like, say the conversation in the final scene)? Had you been mentally wrestling with these questions about your relationship with games for long before you started writing the essay?</strong></em></p>
<p>In my old age (I’m 28.5 years old), I have started finally writing the “final drafts” of things I’ve been trying to write for a long time. Last year, I got a flash fiction piece called <a href="http://www.smokelong.com/consequence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Consequence”</a> published about a woman who loses a baby. I’ve written maybe 15 poems about the same subject. I wrote two drafts of “Consequence” itself before it was published, but really, every other poem before that was an earlier “draft.”</p>
<p>I haven’t tried to write about video games before, but I have been wrestling with it a lot. This sort of came to a head when I was talking to Alyse Knorr when <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>came out. She had suggested I should pitch a book, since Boss Fight’s authors are largely male. Ideally, I’d want to write a book about <em>Silent Hill 3</em>. The game deals a lot with violence, the human condition, and birth—all things that I write about a lot. But I have only ever watched my husband, Kenny, play this game, and absolutely could not play it myself—it’s technically difficult <em>and</em> scary. I thought maybe I could co-write it with Kenny—he’s the trivia expert on Silent Hill and has the symbol that’s used as the save spot for a tattoo—and I’d come at it from the philosophical standpoint. When I pitched my idea to Kenny, his very first reaction was, “You’d have to play through it. I insist.” And so I got stuck. Kenny was basically saying I’d have to “earn” my right to talk about this game. But I felt like I, too, had suffered through it. Kenny made me watch him play it <em>in the dark!</em></p>
<p>Finally, these conversations with my coworkers pushed me over. I wrote the essay.</p>
<p><em><strong>Mostly you have written poetry, as well as some short fiction. This essay represents your entry into a new frontier of creative nonfiction. How does your writing process differ (if at all) from one genre to another? Do you have to employ different skills, or access different parts of your brain (so to speak), when writing prose rather than poetry?</strong></em></p>
<p>I had a few reasons for abandoning prose for most of my formal schooling, but the most practical was that I get very overwhelmed when I have to revise something that I can’t see all of at once. The way I cheat with this is two-fold: most of my poems are part of longer series (and thus bleed into the long-form of most prose) and all of my prose is modular. Did I just give something away? Sorry! Everything is in sections. Everything is compartmentalized. Then, I can write everything in blocks and rearrange them like you might rearrange the order you have pictures hung on a wall.</p>
<p>Also, podcasts. I listen to a lot of podcasts. Like a LOT: sometimes 3 hours a day. Listening to podcasts helped me unlock something in my brain in terms of the way I write prose now. When I write prose now, I imagine I’m talking on a podcast.</p>
<p><em><strong>In your essay, you write about the reasons why </strong></em><strong>Pokémon Blue</strong><em><strong> is the only game you’ve ever beaten. Have you tried playing any other turn-based role playing games? Besides the obvious (Zelda games), are there any other game genres in which you’ve found any success or particular enjoyment?</strong></em></p>
<p>So, this section was a lot longer originally in the essay, and Kenny helped me cut it down. There is one other game genre in which I’ve won: point-and-click adventure games. Specifically <em>The Curse of Monkey Island</em> and <em>Escape from Monkey Island. </em>I have beaten those games, but I didn’t count them because they are so linear. There’s only one way to beat them. The first two Pokémon games have 150 Pokémon you can use to fight the different gym leaders and trainers. Point-and-click games have solutions—solutions that I could have, if I wanted, googled.</p>
<p>Kenny would also like me to point out that I did play a <em>lot</em> of <em>Skyrim</em>. I had watched him play through the main campaign when I started <em>Skyrim</em>, and so I picked it up later and played a lot of the sort of “main sidequests” that he hadn’t done. I liked that game because I could sneak—I would literally sneak my entire way to different new locations, even though it was slower, just to get my stat up—and so I could oftentimes take out entire mini-dungeons at a distance with my bow and arrow. Kenny and I have also played through a fairly large portion of <em>Resident Evil 5</em> together: I tend to, not so surprisingly, use the sniper from the high ground while he attacked enemies up close. Oh, and <em>Stardew Valley</em>. But guess what I avoided for as long as possible? THE MINE (<em>i.e.</em>, the only place where you have to fight anything).</p>
<p><em><strong>If you could create a video game (of any type, any scale, no limitations) based on any work of literature, what work would you choose, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have been reading and re-reading a lot of children’s books recently (for no reason (I’m kidding; I have a baby)) and will give two short answers related to that and one long one.</p>
<p><em>Harold and the Purple Crayon</em> where you could draw things and have you interact with them, but in the boundless way Harold does (I realize a game like <em>Scribblenauts</em> has similarly tried to create this).</p>
<p><em>Corduroy</em>. I have very little conception of this, except that I love the idea of roaming around a department store at night as a cozy bear. Also, in terms of a “game”—Corduroy never does find his button! And so a game where there’s not really a way to “win” would be great. I’ve also dressed up as Corduroy for Halloween. Also, that second to last page, when she says, “I like you the way you are, but you’ll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened,” makes me weep every time.</p>
<p>Finally, if <em>The Dark Tower</em> series could be a game, that would be amazing. I’m talking about a full-fledged, seven-part game, like the books, with all deviations and explorations. Kenny has read me those books out loud, and I think my favorite part about them is that for “gunslingers” there’s remarkably little shooting. Most of it is travel, exploration, and problem solving. If I could have a game with the richness of those settings, the character development, and the puzzles, I would play that game to its credits.</p>
<p><em><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></em></p>
<p>I have written half a book’s worth of poems about brassica/two women who live on a farm. I have my thesis, which is in two parts, Part 1: Ashley Sugarnotch and the Wolf and Part 2: The Rest of Us. I have an essay on touch. I am trying to figure out how these things go together and should exist in the world. I think I have more brassica poems in me. I feel like I have a book in there somewhere, but I don’t know where yet!</p>
<p><em><strong>What have you read recently that you’d like to recommend?</strong></em></p>
<p>I just finished the current collections of <em>The Wicked and the Divine</em> and really enjoyed that. Kenny is currently reading me the eighth book (or installment 4.5) of the <em>Dark Tower</em> series and just finished reading me <em>It</em>. Also, if anyone else tells me that clown is creepy, I’m gonna start yelling. The scariest thing in that book is the intense loneliness of the children. I don’t think I’ve ever wept as hard at a book as I have at the initial introduction to Ben Hanscom. I’m reading Kenny <em>Little House on the Banks of Plum Creek </em>and also <em>A Wrinkle in Time</em>. I’m also slowly reading <em>The Desires of Mothers to Please Others in Letters</em> by Bernadette Mayer. I guess none of those are poetry…whoops!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was eleven, I convinced my dad to buy <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. </i>The pictures—Link in his green tunic, mostly—reminded me of <i>King’s Quest</i>, which I had watched him puzzle through on our computer. My dad had played video games as long as video games had existed, and he was always willing to invest in a new toy. Instead of playing OoT ourselves, my brother, Blake, and I watched him play through it. My dad was the training coordinator (a position I later realized was significantly less fancy than I thought) at Papa John’s, so sometimes he was home during a weekday. Once, I was home sick and helped him solve the puzzles in the Spirit Temple. Another time, he intentionally didn’t save his progress so when I got home from school he could show me King Zora squeaking aside to open the path to Lord Jabu Jabu. (I still make that squeaking noise when I’m squeezing past someone in a hallway or scooching over on a bench.)</p>
<p>When he finally went head to head with Ganon, it took forever. He couldn’t shoot light arrows accurately enough, or he ran out of magic, or he would fall jumping to slash Ganon with the Master Sword. Later, watching Blake play, I realized that part hadn’t been particularly hard—my dad was just not as good at video games as I thought he was.</p>
<p>But he was still a lot better than I was.</p>
<hr />
<p>The year before<i> OoT</i>, I had saved up money in the summer doing odd jobs for my grandparents to buy an original Game Boy (used, missing the battery cover) and <i>Pokèmon Blue</i>. Other kids in my neighborhood had been playing it, I watched the anime in the morning, and I was obsessed. I loved the idea of little creatures, and I loved the idea of collecting things. But most of all, I loved that the turn-based style of play meant little-to-no stress on my part. I didn’t have to worry about the timing of my button pressing. I could strategize. I could win.</p>
<p>The first day, I played from the moment I got it until I fell asleep. I went through twelve batteries. When I closed my eyes, the phosphenes I saw behind my eyelids were pixelated.</p>
<p>On my first playthrough, I did not learn that I should maybe have more than one strong Pokèmon if I expected to breeze through the Elite Four, so I looked up the Missingno. cheat and rare-candied my way to victory.</p>
<p>But I did it! I beat the game. I have since beaten it one other time, on winter break of my junior year of undergrad.</p>
<p>In sitting down to write this essay, I was trying to figure out how many video games I’ve beaten. I’m not talking “completed” here; for example, I never caught ‘em all in <i>Pokèmon Blue</i> (let’s be real, I didn’t have enough (<i>i.e.</i>, any) friends to trade with even if I had gotten close). I asked myself: how many games have I beaten the main quest of and gotten the credits to scroll?</p>
<p>It’s one. It’s <i>Pokèmon Blue. </i></p>
<hr />
<p>As a high schooler in the mid-aughts, I volunteered at a place called the Lower Paxton Youth Center. In a squat, one-story, cinderblock building owned by the township, we had poetry readings, vegan dinners, and other weird art events. Our main events, however, were shows: little concerts with local and touring bands. I was on the youth board as secretary, so I was intimately involved with running the place. I sold wristbands at the door. I sold pizza by the slice. I talked to bands between sets. I learned their lyrics and screamed them. I waltzed; I threw my body around; I was a part of it.</p>
<p>However, a group of people came to shows that we, the kids who booked the shows and ran the venue, despised: the scene kids. These were our peers that didn’t care about the music. They didn’t want to contribute to the community. Instead, they wanted to be there because of the <i>scene</i>. Which, of course, meant they wanted to <i>be</i> <i>seen</i>.</p>
<p>When thinking about the way I love video games, my first thought was: <i>Am I a fraud?</i> But this I quickly dismissed. I wasn’t lying, per se. Then, I realized my real question: <i>Am I scene kid? </i></p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s the thing. I’m not good at video games. I was good at <i>Pokèmon Blue </i>for two reasons: 1) It was turned based, and 2) I cheated. (Though, the second time I beat it, I won because I patiently trained my Pokèmon in the tall grass and also spent much of my early days getting a Gyrados.)</p>
<p>In Alyse Knorr’s book <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, she writes about how the muscle memory of beating Bowser came back even fifteen years after she had last played: “My <i>SMB3</i> skills came as a result of hours and hours of childhood practice—enough, statistically speaking, to achieve true ‘expert’ status.” My husband, Kenny, also has these moves stitched into his being. On Friday nights, he’ll often suggest we drink Scotch, order pizza, and play <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, switching back and forth as we beat or lose each level. What this turns into is Kenny effortlessly running and hopping through each level, taking secret paths to collect extra coins, and knowing precisely when to employ different suits, while I try to jump over a chasm and instead jump directly into the center of the chasm.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Kenny said to me one night, after I had died all of fifteen seconds into a level. “You really look like you’re intentionally trying to fall down those chasms.”</p>
<p>I never learned these patterns of muscle memory, partly because I’m less interested in games without explicit stories, partly from watching my friends and family play video games more often than playing them myself. At this point in my life, as a writer, working as an editor, with a baby to take care of, I will likely never put in the effort to learn them. This timing involved with pressing buttons in early classics like Super Mario doesn’t exactly transfer to the modern games I’m more interested in, like <i>Skyrim</i>, but those skills definitely seem to help.</p>
<hr />
<p>I would say my favorite game series is still Zelda. I’ve dressed up as Link for Halloween more than once (this upcoming Halloween, I plan on being Link, Kenny is going to be a gender-bent Prince Zelda, and our son will wear a chicken hat; he’s going to be a cucco), I own a Link-tunic hoodie with the Hylian shield sewn to the back and a pointy hood to cap it off, and recently I took pictures of myself and my son wearing matching Link outfits. When my son cries in his sleep, I sneak into his room and sing him “Epona’s Song.” It always calms him down. I picked this to be his lullaby in part because it’s my favorite Zelda song (and the more obvious “Zelda’s Lullaby” has notes that are too high) and because, like most video game tunes, it’s meant to repeat on a loop: a perfect way to sing a lullaby for thirty seconds or three minutes. I sang it often when he was still in utero, instilling it as comfort even before he was born.</p>
<p>But all this said, I haven’t even beaten my favorite game, the one I started with: <i>Ocarina of Time</i>. I have tried many times since my dad beat it. I can easily navigate the Great Deku Tree, Dodongo’s Cavern, and Lord Jabu-Jabu’s Belly. Once, I got stuck at the Water Temple (a classic spot to fail). The last time I tried, I got stuck in the Gerudo Fortress. Even looking up how to sneak past the busty Gerudo women, I couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>I have played about two thirds of<i> Skyward Sword</i>, but it’s taken me years. In <i>Skyward Sword</i>, you have trials you must complete in the Silent Realm before moving on to the dungeon for that area. In each trial, you transport to a ghostly parallel version of a map you’ve already encountered. Here, you have to collect Sacred Tears. Sounds easy enough, except that there are terrifying shells of armor called Guardians that will come after you with their huge weapons (along with heart-pounding music) if you: 1) take too long to find the next Sacred Tear, 2) are seen by Watchers, these creepy ghost things with lanterns, or 3) touch silvery water (that’s usually ebbing around a Sacred Tear). One hit from a Guardian ends the trial, and you have to start over.</p>
<p>The first time I played through the first Silent Realm, I yelled the entire time. Zelda games, with a few notable exceptions, tend not to be scary (at least not like one of Kenny’s favorite franchises, <i>Silent Hill</i>), but these sections, with their creepy twilight, all-encompassing danger, and ambient music really stressed me out. I, of course, lost my first trial in the Silent Realm and my second. Kenny was sleeping (he had not appreciated my yelling), so I put the game away and didn’t play again for six months. Finally, with Kenny’s emotional support and the volume turned down a bit, I got through the first trial. I beat the dungeon and then, with another Silent Realm waiting for me, got scared and put the game away for another six months. I am still in the middle of this process. Since I started the game, I have gotten accepted into an MFA program, gotten married, completed my MFA program, gotten a job, and had a baby.</p>
<hr />
<p>The truth of the matter is I’d prefer to watch someone play video games than play them myself. I want to read video-game specific wikis about them, I want to sing my son “Epona’s Song,” I want to have Kenny cross stitch me a Triforce for my desk at work, I want to read books about the history of video games like Alyse’s book, I want to dress up as Link for Halloween, and I want to buy the <i>Silent Hill Soundtrack</i> on vinyl from EBay as a surprise for Kenny because he missed buying it from the source before it sold out. But I only sometimes want to actually play video games. I’d rather sit snuggled on the couch as my baby sleeps, knitting him a cucco hat for Halloween while I watch my husband play through the demo of <i>Prey, </i>yelling and laughing in surprise when a mimic appears.</p>
<p>As much as I can admit this, I can’t help but hate myself a little bit for it. I can’t help but see myself as a scene kid. Because there’s something logically flawed to the idea of rejecting the fundamental purpose of video games: playing them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Walking to the parking garage at work, I hear three tech dudes talking beside me. These guys always exit the office around the same time I’m leaving for the day, strolling to have a smoke away from the building’s main entrance. I hear one of them say, “Oh yeah, and <i>Half-Life</i> <i>2</i> was so glitchy. My copy let me walk right up to the G-man.”</p>
<p>“A-ha,” I say, interjecting myself into their conversation, “but what’s better? A glitchy game or a game that doesn’t exist at all?” I am, of course, implying that the imperfect <i>Half-Life 2 </i>was better than the non-existent and long yearned-for <i>Half-Life 3.</i></p>
<p>The three men size me up. I am not only a woman but a pregnant one. Do I really know what I’m saying here? I’ve made a safe entrance into this conversation, because I’m going to pass them to get to my car, so I know they won’t be able to probe my knowledge much. Admittedly, I’m more familiar with <i>Portal</i>, the spin-off puzzle game in the same universe, than I am with the <i>Half-Life</i> games. Finally, after what seems like a long time, but is really only a few steps, they chuckle.</p>
<p>“Good point,” one says.</p>
<p>In my car, I feel oddly triumphant (I call Kenny immediately to tell him) but also mad at myself. I don’t actually want to be friends with these dudes, nor do I feel any need to impress them. But in that moment, I wanted them to know their conversation wasn’t exclusive. I wanted them to know that I, too, know about video games.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been playing <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> since 1994. I’ve owned several versions, on the PlayStation, the Saturn, PS2, and PS3. There’s something about going into a city screen, instructing the PC to improve agriculture or city walls, then meeting with NPCs for wine just before marching to war against a nearby city-state that appeals to me. It’s a weird kind of  humanity.</p>
<p><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> is a long-running series with thirteen iterations, spanning 1985 through 2016. The premise never varies: playing as one of the over 250 characters in the game you attempt to unify China. It’s a world-building, army-fighting, character-recruiting epic. Characters age and die, alliances are formed and broken. Besides the insertion of magic (a device of the historical novel from which the series is adapted), it’s based in the real world, on real events that happened in China from 196 AD until 280 AD. It was an era of civil war that resulted in three rival kingdoms: northern Wei, South-Eastern Wu, and South-Western Shu, ruled respectively by Cao Cao, Sun Quan, and Liu Bei.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, Wei, usurped by the Jin dynasty, unified China. Historically speaking (for me), it was the basis in reality that made <em>Romance </em>resonate. Liu Bei really lived and died, a failed hero. So did Cao Cao, the main unifier of China, and even Lu Bu, the traitor. Each character (again, over 250 of them) has a brief bio to click on, to teach their segment of history.</p>
<p>The newest version, <em>Romance XIII</em>, is a brilliant game, hard and beautiful with new features I adore (I love that newer versions allow the player to be any character, not just rulers). By all rights, I should only be playing the most recent game. But I don’t. Mostly, I play <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire</em> on the PlayStation. It’s the first one I encountered and I’ve spent hundreds of hours on it. But I don’t play it for enjoyment, not exactly.</p>
<p>Recently, I went through difficult times. Aside from the depression that I’ve ignored (until recently) off and on, for my entire life, there’s simply been a lot of death around me. And my moods have been the blackest of my life. And it was during this period that I found myself unmotivated to start anything new, but craving <em>Romance IV</em>. And when I played, when I allowed the hours to tick by in my measured domination of ancient China, I found myself feeling better. Not a lot, necessarily, but marginally. Enough to get myself out of the house to work, to meet friends, to work out. To show up to life.</p>
<p>It’s like I needed a hint of comfort, a way to drain my brain of negativity and fill it with…emptiness. A comforting emptiness, a zen-like relaxation. It wasn’t a state I needed for long, just a temporary pit spot on the way to happier times. But I realized that, over the years, I’d dipped back into <em>Wall of Fire</em> precisely during these hard times, when I needed that brief boost. It was soothing, comforting, a warm bath.</p>
<p>When I discovered my motivation, simple and unmemorable as it may be, I wondered about other people’s. Why do we return to these games we’ve utterly mastered? To answer that question, I asked seven other writers what their “comfort food” was.</p>
<p>This is what they told me.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dance-Dance.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1997" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Dance-Dance.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="405" /></a></p>
<p><em>Dance Dance Revolution </em>(Arcade)<br />
by Anthony Moll<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I am no longer the 16-year-old boy with bleached hair and pierced face who spent hours on end playing <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> in the arcade of a shitty hotel-casino in Reno, Nevada. My body is no longer thin and unhindered, my feet no longer flick effortlessly along to late-90s techno and world beats. I am no longer a twink with punk rock leanings. Now more than double that age, I am a writer and academic, on medication to control my cholesterol. I’m not old, but I can no longer call myself young.</p>
<p>Like many living in the mid-Atlantic region, I find myself visiting Ocean City at least once during the summer season. The boardwalk there is typical of gaudy American tourism—saltwater taffy and visiting suburbanites, t-shirt stands every hundred yard selling tees with slogans like <em>YOLO</em> or <em>Less Government, More Guns</em>.</p>
<p>But the boardwalk also has arcades, and at least one keeps an old <em>DDR</em> machine. I make an effort to visit each year. I am only now realizing how restorative this annual tradition is, how much my body needs to be reminded of its history.</p>
<p>In America, where people of all backgrounds obsess over youth culture, we call the discomfort of aging into one’s thirties a “crisis.” For many queer men, this period can be especially disorienting, as we find ourselves struggling to find our place in subcultures that agonize over being small, young, and fit.</p>
<p>I am not immune to this obsession, but playing <em>DDR</em> reminds me that I can still move. I can still react. My body is still strong, and I do more to take care of it with each passing year. I don’t pretend that a dancing video game makes me young again, but for a moment each year—the length of three songs for a dollar—I move my body in a way that reminds me that I have not lost much, and I have gained both experience and taste as I’ve grown into adulthood.</p>

<p><em>Harvest Moon 64 </em>(N64)<br />
by Tabitha Blankenbiller</p>
<p><em>Harvest Moon 64</em> is a pixel-rendered love letter to melancholy, opening with a cut scene on your grandfather’s deathbed. In the background, a MIDI melody evokes the inevitable churn and crush of seasons. You inherit his farm in a Japanese mountain village and are tasked with bringing the blank, fertile space back to life. This is a place where generations have lived and died like perennial plants, returning in the legacies of their children. It’s a town where vocation defines personality: Karen at the vineyard is “sassy,” Ellie the baker is “sweet,” Maria the librarian is “shy,” and Popuri the flower shop attendant is debatably sentient. The avatar’s blank back story—he’d grown up in “the City” and hadn’t visited this close-knit community since childhood—were thin lines I rendered with my own small town ennui. My family moved from “The City” of Tacoma, Washington up to Mt. Rainier’s foothills when I was 12, and in the three years between the relocation and <em>Harvest Moon’s</em> release, my trepidation over our new home blossomed into hate. I blamed the new tiny town for my loneliness, boredom, awkwardness, and inconsequence. <em>Harvest Moon</em> was a meditation set in the world I claimed to despise, and I visited every day for hours. There was a strange excitement in slowly building a life, and the way pushing a button to water the plants mimicked nurture. I crafted the quickest, most efficient method to riches (investing in cows and corn) and learned the hiding spots of all the rare items scattered around the limited world. I lived enough lifetimes to woo and marry every girl in town. I savored the night a mysterious visitor showed up at the bar, knowing she’s programmed to never return. The routes I created through this mirage are still in my muscle memory when I sink back into the game, every few years in a dark stretch of boring winter, as my 20-year-old N64 grows ever glitched. I still tear up when I hear the opening song, the electric notes dredging up all the old drafts of myself playing a dozen versions of this boy on his farm. The beautiful boundaries of the town reflected what I couldn’t appreciate until I moved away to a new City for college, then grew up and moved back to another Nowhere. <em>Harvest Moon</em> teaches the peace of structure and the weary sadness of finite youth; the mortality of The City against the Mountain.</p>

<p><em>Super Mario World</em> (SNES)<br />
by Catherine Kyle</p>
<p><em>Super Mario World </em>was the third game I ever got, after <em>Albert Odyssey </em>for the Sega Saturn and a <em>Sailor Moon </em>fighting game for the SNES. At age 10, I came home from school one day to find my dad playing, clad in pajamas, bare toes pressing into the carpet with each of Mario’s jumps. “Surprise,” he said casually. He loved gaming as much as I did, but we were only just learning this.</p>
<p>In <em>Understanding Comics</em>, Scott McCloud argues, “The more cartoony a face is, […] the more people it could be said to describe.” Thus, generic faces are easier for viewers to project themselves onto than highly detailed ones. I think the same could be said of interactive stories.</p>
<p>The plot of <em>Mario </em>is pretty straightforward: a monster has abducted a princess and it’s Mario’s/your job to rescue her. Though Mario is an adult male plumber, he and his story are generic enough that a tween girl and her sommelier father could relate to him. And not just relate to him, but take advantage of the story’s simplicity to fill in gaps with their imaginations.</p>
<p>Playing <em>Mario </em>as a kid felt like going on a quest. Not just one I was experiencing vicariously, but one I was actively co-creating by heightening drama, inventing backstory, and adding dialogue in my mind. The sparseness of the narrative provided by the creators launched flights of imagination I still recall—and enjoy—to this day.</p>

<p><em>Goldeneye 007</em> (N64)<br />
by Steven Leyva</p>
<p>Growing up in Houston, Texas, under its ubiquitous humidity and sprawling beltways, I spent many hours during the summers walking between two friends’ homes to play N64’s <em>GoldenEye 007</em>. The three of us, James, Brentley, and myself, could affectionately be called late90s blerds, though we also played basketball and did step team and various other machismo-inspired activities. Playing video games, however, was our raison d’être—that and James had an older sister was as fine as Tisha Campbell in <em>House Party</em>—and our game of choice was this FPS masterpiece, where you could drop proximity mines, duel with slaps only, and fire rocket launchers all in the guise of characters from the Bond movie canon.</p>
<p><em>GoldenEye</em> was the like the ¼ pounder w/ cheese of video games, instantly satisfying and available at all hours of the day. Looking back, however, we probably treated those gaming sessions as a poor person’s summer camp. Each of us lived in separate but nearby apartment complexes; each alone most of the day while our mothers worked. We were unabashedly poor in our detailed ironing of secondhand jeans into starchy perfection. Lord only knows how any of us even owned a Nintendo 64 at the time. There was something democratic and communal about <em>GoldenEye</em>, where the multiplayer was so superior to the story mode. Marx is probably playing it right now in the afterlife.</p>
<p>And sure there was a gladiatorial aspect to the whole affair, where our currency was acknowledged defeat and the rites of trash talk, but mostly I think we felt a sense of naked joy in wasting time. For that pleasure, I remain a glutton. These days I “play” <em>GoldenEye</em>, by watching Let’s Play videos on YouTube with my 6-year-old son​, while wondering if he will have his own clique of bad blerds to Bond with.</p>

<p><em>World of Warcraft</em> (PC)<em><br />
</em>by Tara D. Gillespie</p>
<p>I was a huge LOTR nerd. So, to say I felt at home running around a fantasy world as a bronze-armored wood-elf warrior is an understatement. It felt destined, in fact, because it had always been a far-fetched dream of mine. I’m still kinda waiting for my letter from Hogwarts because I’d be badass at spell casting.</p>
<p>When I discovered the <em>World of Warcraft</em> it was like <em>Everquest</em>, but WAY better. The colors were brighter, the music was soulful, the storylines were intense and emotional; there were maps! The time in-game seemed endless, questing, pursuing specific gear or pets, working on reputation and professions, fighting in PVP grounds, accumulating achievements, analyzing talents and my toon’s DPS output, and exploring two continents.</p>
<p>Fast-forward twelve years and I am still invigorated by the dooming bass drums and the heroic blares of horns that echo from my login screen. Sure, I played <em>Frozen Throne</em>, some <em>Starcraft</em>, and most recently dabbled in <em>Overwatch</em>, but I always feel the magnetic pull to play <em>WoW</em>. I don’t have a lot of free time nowadays with a toddler and grad school so, if I’m going to game, I’m going to play what I enjoy the most.</p>
<p>After playing <em>WoW</em> obsessively for years I’ve become emotionally attached to the world and my main character, a Night Elf Hunter named Tinweaura. We’ve spent a lot of time together, she’s seen me through break-ups and my chaotic twenties where I had no idea who the hell I was. If I felt lost IRL, I could always login where I felt sure of my actions and goals.</p>
<p>When I login now, I recognize my history; where I’ve been but also how I’ve grown. My friend’s list is a blur of inactive, greyed out names: old boyfriends and friends who I’d convinced to play, but who no longer play, mimic those relationships in real life. Where I was once concerned with being the best, insecure, if I didn’t use every opportunity to play to demonstrate I was a valuable player, I’m now at peace with logging in once in a while, sometimes just to take a fantasy-break amongst the pink cherry-blossom trees in Pandaria, or on top of an icy mountain in Northrend, or if I’m feeling really nostalgic, maybe fly home to the great tree island of Teldrassil because, really, who the fuck cares. The game will always be here.</p>

<p><em>Skate 2</em> (PS3)<br />
by Joel Hans</p>
<p><em>Skate 2</em> plays to some of my deepest obsessions: a respect for skateboarding as sport and art form, my love of steep learning curves, my endless desire to explore a territory. I’ve found myself cringing at the Hall of Meat, where the sounds of breaking bones are tallied into a score. That feature always fascinated me, to see pain made both objective and <em>the objective</em>.</p>
<p>Those crashes remind me of when I was a teenager, terrible at taking falls on my own skateboard, and how my left elbow received consistent blows, equipping me with an impressive <em>swellbow</em>.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by <em>Skate 2</em>’s approach to physical pain. After a crash, pressing L1 and R1 together teleports back in time and space to right before a fall. And there were certainly times I wished for such a feature in real life, to go back before the gap ollie where I caught my back wheels in the grass, my elbow finding concrete with all my bodyweight behind it.</p>
<p>All this fascination is amplified by the fact that my first sessions in <em>Skate 2</em> were with my dog, a 10-week-old puppy then, falling asleep in the gap between my two outstretched legs as I sat on the floor. So, yes, the game has sophisticated gameplay, a novel approach to physical pain, and a stunning isolated architecture of this endlessly skate-able city, but it also has a connection to a fully good time in my life.</p>
<p>I’ve flung myself into this beautiful anomaly: 200 hours and eight years later and I’m still finding new corners of the city, still cruising familiar streets, still playing with my dog nearby. I’m still pressing R1+L1 to go back in time. Still probing my elbow for the remnant of all that old pain: a little shelf of extra bone that shouldn’t be there, but is, and that’s okay.</p>

<p><em>Ocarina of Time</em> (N64)<br />
by Kerrin Smith</p>
<p>When <em>Ocarina of Time</em> first came out, I didn’t play it. Instead I compulsively watched my two brothers struggle with its puzzles and bosses—probably too advanced for elementary school kids—and I got hooked on <em>Ocarina</em>’s story and mythos. Like, utterly sucked in. Then one day my older brother, Devin, reported that he “lost” the cartridge. When I furiously confronted him, he confessed that he hadn’t actually lost it but lent it; he’d gotten frustrated, and instead of admitting he was stumped, he contracted our preteen neighbor. When we got the game back, he had been catapulted through the plot. The only way to fill in the missing chunks of story was to play it myself.</p>
<p>Even though my spectating had technically spoiled the end for me, the game still drew me in, because it was the first game that made me curious. It made me think, and look at situations and environments in new ways. In fact, I fondly remember the battle with mini-boss Dark Link as a lesson in creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>My 19th or 20th run of <em>Ocarina</em> was just a few months ago, and I still stumbled upon caves and treasure that were completely new. I’m playing <em>Breath of the Wild</em> now, and while this masterful new installment radically breaks from past Zelda gameplay, its essence of storytelling and discovery is the same as <em>Ocarina</em>’s, which is why Hyrule has been my alter-universe of choice for nearly two decades.</p>

<p><em>Gabriel Ojeda-Sague&#8217;s poem, <a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2016/04/27/dream-6-isaac/" target="_blank">&#8220;Dream #6: Isaac,&#8221;</a> appeared in our </em>Solstice <em>Temple Issue. Below, he talks with editor Phil Spotswood about grief, decontextualizing, violence, and more.</em></p>
<p><strong>PS: In a <a href="https://www.poetryproject.org/wp-content/uploads/246_finalj_1bf.pdf" target="_blank">review</a> of <em><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/290768494/Where-Everything-is-in-Halves-by-Gabriel-Ojeda-Sague" target="_blank">Where Everything is in Halves</a></em> (Be About It, 2015), a chapbook in which you explore The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker as a mapping of grief (among other themes), Jai Arun Ravine mentions they heard you at a reading talking about </strong>“<strong>game play as a way to work through grief</strong>”<strong>; is there something inherent in video games that allows the player to explore the potential of reworking a map, a code, a space?</strong></p>
<p>GOS: My understanding of a connection between games and grief actually comes unluckily through a bad experience with the two. After my father died in 2005, I got badly addicted to the game World of Warcraft. It’s a sort of joke people say, WoW addictions, but they are real and actually really interesting when you think about the way they are formed. Anyways, I was basically playing hours on end everyday in the time after my dad died. And so, most of my mental space was occupied inside of a virtual space. It’s a disturbing experience, actually, when done incorrectly. In 2015, when I started writing Where Everything is in Halves, I thought I should put myself in that mindset again, but this time be conscious of it, prod it, investigate it, put it under pressure, think critically about the game itself. Wind Waker wasn’t a conscious choice at first, but I realized quickly how much the game is about isolation, misunderstanding, devastation, all felt in the space of grief. And with Zelda specifically I was curious about playing as a vulnerable child, one with the burden of saving the whole world on his shoulders. So there it was like, play as if you were in 6th grade again (when my dad passed) in such an unhealthy behavior, but put interpretive pressure on the game and on your grief so you can get something out of it. And that’s what the poems are doing. Games, I think, have an innate usefulness for such a project because they are invented spaces that you help form, deform, and generally interact with. Even those churned-out free app games have a malleability of form because we recognize the form is invented and is there for us to work with or against. So taking the form of Wind Waker, the conceit of which is small islands separated by massive stretches of sea, and then calling the sea that which is unknown and calling the islands that which is intimate, you’ve put pressure on the form that was invented for you to put pressure on. It’s just a work of interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>PS: I remember playing Wind Waker and setting out for the first time on sea, being sort of overwhelmed by the seemingly open world and being really excited about it at first, no Zelda game had given that scope before; and then, the more I played, the more lonely it felt, like you mentioned. There are moments of stillness, bobbing on the water, that are deafening in their silence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I love what you mention about the </strong>“<strong>malleability of form</strong>”<strong> of video games; I think that’s so accurate. There is a certain agency that entering into a game allows the player that they can’t necessarily experience outside of the virtual world, a space to interrogate their inner world through the conceit of the game. Near the end of your Zelda chapbook, there is a poem </strong>“<strong>The Sea (Triforce)</strong>”<strong>; I think it’s a moment in the game where Link has to collect the triforce shards before confronting Ganondorf, and you’re sailing around looking for these tiny pieces. In searching for one particular piece, the speaker in the poem says: </strong>“<strong>I am touching the iron bars and look just past to see a horrible virus inside. I have to get in and feel that virus. I didn’t know seagulls ate pears, but they do. 7 points in the 7000 x 7000. I am not the child-hero. The child-hero, I mean, takes the seagulls to 7 points to make them glow and when they do the bars open and I, the child-hero, I mean, goes in to feel the virus.</strong>”<strong> The speaker enacts a sort of ritual to get past/break down these iron bars, to get at the virus. Across the Zelda chapbook and your poem inspired by The Binding of Isaac, there seems to be an insistence on ritual, and I’m wondering about the intersections between video game and ritual, what is at that intersection and how you prepare yourself to enter into that space.</strong></p>
<p>GOS: Let me say one thing towards your first point and then I’ll answer your question. Loneliness is definitely one of the primary aesthetics/moods of Wind Waker. There must be a shared moment for all players of the game where they are sailing and they just stop. And they look around and notice not a single island is near them. Nothing. Maybe a storm somewhere over there, but other than that nothing. Ganondorf at the end of the game actually outright addresses this. He says “They are vast seas&#8230;None can swim across them&#8230;They yield no fish to catch&#8230;So many pathetic creatures, scattered across a handful of islands….Your gods destroyed you.” It’s his grand final speech. There’s a moment there where the game is explicitly saying that this huge ocean is useless or nonproductive, that it serves only to separate. This is people’s main frustration with Wind Waker, but it’s really what is most interesting about the game. I feel similarly now playing Final Fantasy XV, which I have similar moments where I just stop the car, look at the landscape, and think “What the hell am I doing? Where is anything?” This mood is most prominent in “The Sea (Triforce)” because this is the part of the game that EVERYBODY hates. You have to find 8 maps on 8 different islands, take them to Tingle and pay him to translate them, then use those maps to find 8 triforce shards. It’s a total run around.</p>
<p>Anyways, the lines you quote have a real in-game referent. One of the triforce shards is on an island in a chest behind a set of iron bars. To open the bars, you feed a seagull a pear, which lets you control it (lol, I know), and you have to hit 7 crystals with the seagull to light them up. When they are lit, the bars open, the map is yours. A lot of the chapbook and my Binding of Isaac poem in Cartridge take real in-game referents and just make them strange. Usually by decontextualizing them. So that’s what I’ve done here. The short answer on why ritual and games are related is: they both come with instructions. A lot of my poems, generally, are interested in ritual and instructions, specifically on instructions of the impossible, hopeless instructions, achievable instructions (much of this comes from my love for Grapefruit by Yoko Ono). In this section you are quoting, I’m deforming the instructions of the game (move the seagull, open the chest) to make some sort of statement on sickness/illness, which is one of the major aspects of the chapbook.</p>
<p><strong>PS: As you were explaining the mechanics of the triforce map and the seagull, I was vividly remembering that bit about the game, how frustrating and difficult it was to control the bird (and how strange!) It’s a moment that you wonderfully decontextualize, and the player’s control of the character sort of mimics the control of the bird, which, decontextualized, speaks to the potential for the player to navigate their inner sense of self.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Binding of Isaac is an indie game that riffs off of the Biblical story of Abraham and Isaac, the sacrificial son. In the Biblical story, much like in the game, Isaac’s parent (in-game, the mother) is ordered by (supposedly god) to kill her son, for he has become tainted with sin. I’ve been thinking about sacrifice and ritual, and sacrifice as a kind of ritual (in that, like you say, they both come with instructions.) Your poem in Cartridge Lit, </strong>“<strong>Dream #6: Isaac</strong>”<strong> opens with the future continuous verb </strong>“<strong>I’ll be</strong>”<strong> which immediately seems to set up a performative space. Before diving further into the poem, I’m wondering if you’d want to speak on this enactment of performance (in Binding, in poetry).</strong></p>
<p>GOS: Sure! “I’ll be” and “you be” are roleplaying terms, most often said by kids. Like, you can imagine a kid saying “I’ll be the princess and you be the wolf.” . In this case, it also has to do with character creation, “I’ll be Isaac,” “I’ll be Cain,” etc. And as well it’s what the game is asking you to accept as a premise. You (the player) control (let’s just assume you are playing Isaac) a boy who has escaped into his basement because his mom wants to kill him, and in there are a bunch of monsters. “I’ll be the joke in the basement” is the explicit mention of the roleplaying the game is making me do. Of clear interest to anyone who writes about or through games is the fact that no matter what we control as the player, we always call that thing “me.” Listen as people explain a game: “Okay, so you’re that giant ogre and you need to crush the villagers,” “you’re the big tower and you need to defend the tower with little towers,” etc. The player becoming someone so entrenched in shame, fear, grief, anxiety, and danger as Isaac is what gets me to write that poem.</p>
<p><strong>PS: I was playing through Binding of Isaac this week, and thinking about how the game thrusts you into the internal space of this character by morphing his basement into this abject pit you have to go deeper and deeper into. I’m really excited that you bring up the verb </strong>“<strong>become,</strong>”<strong> because in this poem, I feel like there is this motion of the </strong>“<strong>I</strong>”<strong> internalizing their interactions with the </strong>“<strong>You</strong>”<strong> and that relationship being projected outwards—this seems to me a motion of becoming—of entering a relationship or emotionally-linked space with another/other. I’m thinking specifically about the second stanza, </strong>“<strong>Miss me: the face is split into three, / but unionizing, page four. / You are full of yolk, family secrets, / dirty shit, cheap shoes. I let it out / in ropes, bad ideas. I don’t shoot / like a laser, it just kinda flows down.</strong>”<strong> Decontextualizing the mechanics of the game, here, I think speaks to this internalizing of space and the subsequent outward projection. Is this another kind of experience video games allow the player to enact?</strong></p>
<p>GOS: Before I get into my answer, I just want to shout-out <a href="https://entropymag.org/hobby-horse-anatomy-bawdy-and-body-in-the-binding-of-isaac-ch-1/" target="_blank">Jace Brittain’s</a> <a href="https://entropymag.org/hobby-horse-anatomy-bawdy-and-body-in-the-binding-of-isaac-ch-2/" target="_blank">3-part</a> <a href="https://entropymag.org/hobby-horse-anatomy-bawdy-and-body-in-the-binding-of-isaac-ch-3/" target="_blank">article</a> on Binding of Isaac that was published on Entropy. It’s so good and even though I read it after I had finished this poem, that article heavily affects my thinking on the game and its thoughts might even slip in here.</p>
<p>If we are to talk about internalizing the exterior, Isaac is the best game for that. In so many ways, all the monsters you fight are Isaac himself. The design of them makes this very explicit (most enemies just look exactly like Isaac). There’s an implication that the basement is Isaac’s emotions, mind, and interiority, throughout the game. Especially, when you start beating the game and get cutscenes like where Isaac finds a noose inside of the boss chest and hangs himself. I came to write “Dream #6” with the frame of mind that the basement was Isaac’s interiority, especially his shame. So as my subject matter I took wet dreams. I’m not very explicit about that in the poem, but basically towards the end of the second stanza and especially the third stanza it is hinted to again and again. The room I was looking at while writing the poem was the following: 6 coins in the middle, blasted out wall (because it was a secret room), 2 fires, and in the middle a shiny, white, hanging body that looks exactly like Isaac. The rooms in Isaac often have these little altars that depict sad and tragic scenes like this with a body that seems to be Isaac’s. So I wanted to take the emotion of a room like this and apply it to a different scenario. This is, I think, what you mean when you are talking about internalizing the exterior and projecting it outward. It’s also how my tool of decontextualizing works. To do so, I just describe plainly what is seen in the room, but remove some information (“something white shining / in the middle, something hanging / and shining white”). This is basically done just by skewing perception of the exterior to create a different emotional response. The resplendent and unknown nature of what I describe is very different from the disturbing and macabre nature of the hanging body in Isaac, but they are both the same body.</p>
<p>Video games are able to do this on the most basic level because they are about interaction. Whereas literature is definitely indebted to simulation in the same degree, there are few chances for literature to have an advanced interactive simulation as a video game would. This is both the grace and famous problem of video games. Think of the cliche argument against violent gaming, that it would cause violence in real life. That argument can only be made if you believe that the interactive simulation is a direct translation of real life action (and vice versa). This same argument was/is still made for books (it’s the great joke of Don Quixote after all.)  But the point at which you realize that the simulation and the interaction are completely skewed from societal action, is when you can exploit those gaps for important interpretive work.</p>
<p><strong>PS: The decontextualizing work that you do while anchoring the poem in the specifics of the game seems to be what enables that opening of valences for the gamer, similar to what happens (what can happen) in poetry—where a moment is ripped out of time while being grounded in that specific moment, and warped to allow multiple modes of access. I’m wondering if there is a violence inherent in this motion, and specifically in the work of this poem. In the lines: </strong>“<strong>Give me / the gift of gutting, or being in the gut, / I want to see the kids you keep in your / gut,</strong>”<strong> violence seems figured as a sort of gift, both used to act upon and embody (as if taking the position of both subject and object); what is the end result of such violence?</strong></p>
<p>GOS: There can be a violence to that kind of decontextualizing, but I think it’s more complete to call it “critical.” And by that, I mean that the gesture I’m doing in these poems is at risk of the same faults as criticism (taking mastery of a work, taking interpretation out of the author’s hands, minimizing of individual readerly experience). Those things could be described as violent. But you are right in saying there is a latent violence that comes through in all my work on games. Returning for a second to “The Sea (Triforce),” I think that poem is the cruelest to Link of all the poems in that chapbook. It allows and focuses the dangers of the videogame world onto him in a totally sadistic way. This was something I was conflicted about while writing it, but that I ultimately decided was productive. Because in both Isaac and Zelda the violence of the surrounding world is the premise of the game. Everything wants to kill you. And everything will, if given the chance. The way in which the bodies of these characters are challenged and endangered in my poems is a product of my own technique but it is not alien at all to the game’s nature. The image of the gut, for example, comes from both an image of the basement as a stomach (the kids being me and the enemies), and an enemy who explodes and lets out flies (the kids being the flies). There is a visceral nature to everything in Isaac, and so much of the expression of shame in that game come from the disturbed bodies of the characters therein. I should mention that the enemy who explodes and lets out flies, when it first sees you, runs in the opposite direction towards a wall and cries until it bursts.</p>
<p>In both poems, violence and sexuality go hand in hand. Asking why would take me a long time to answer and the answer wouldn’t be complete, but it’s just how I wrote them. At the end of Where Everything is in Halves, Ganandorf dies by a sword in his kidney, which a reviewer of the chapbook Ted Rees mentioned as a moment charged by sexuality. It’s not explicitly sexual in that moment, but the whole chapbook has connected acts of violence to sexuality in a way that forces the reader to read that last gesture of killing Ganandorf as one. Here in “Dream #6: Isaac,” we get the hanged body equated to the wet dream with the last line “Sometimes / when kids are sleeping they get whiter.” Though this doesn’t directly relate to your question, I thought it should be mentioned because it gives one sense for the way we might think of violence in these poems and the way you mention it being figured as a gift.</p>
<p><strong>PS: No, I think that connects really well—that enemy in Isaac you mention is one of the most disrupting characters for me—it emits this garbled cry like you mention, and the sheer force of shame (as it relates to your poem) enacts this violence on it that implodes it. And I think the violence turned critical is absolutely necessary in order to subvert a violence that culture (here, a Western, conservative culture) imposes on vulnerable persons; but you’re right, this question and exploration could go on much longer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I do want to turn attention to your new book, <em><a href="https://squareup.com/market/the-operating-system/item/jazzercise-is-a-language-gabriel-ojeda-sague" target="_blank">Jazzercise is a Language</a></em> (The Operating System 2018) and the subversion of violence in it. In the catalogue description of the book, it’s stated: </strong>“‘<strong>Jazzercise is a Language</strong>’<strong> is a long poem that wants to be a smiling, skinny white woman. Here are the leg warmers, head bands, sweats, chants, and two-steps of the 1980’s dance aerobics craze, but decked with the baggage of race, pixelation, rituals, violence, and body horror.</strong>”<strong> Could you talk a bit about this new project and how it relates to violence across your body of work?</strong></p>
<p>GOS: For sure! So the new book is an exploration of the 80’s dance aerobics craze Jazzercise. My interest there is the way Jazzercise was/is an exercise done by mostly white women to the soundtrack of Black and Latino music. So you have these groups of white women on VHS tapes who are saying “you can have the body you want!” “work for it!” and talking about making the waist smaller, tightening the body, defining it, all to the soundtrack of incorrectly framed Black and Latino music. My interests are also in the VHS, the pixelations, the way the bodies don’t look right because of the primitive graphics, etc. And, I love camp, so much of my work has to do with camp, so I was all there for Jazzercise.<br />
If there is any defining theme to my work it’s that I work on what I call critically-maligned media. Media that is deemed unproductive or not worth interpreting. The way Jazzercise gets to violence is through exercise, which is an inherently violent thing. You are basically testing and damaging the body so that it can get stronger and more resistant to future damage. And we have to remember that often exercise can lead to horrible injuries (how many football players do you know of who get concussions, torn ACLs, etc.). So the body which is being controlled, perfected, feminized, is also being beaten up, torn, mangled, and so on. I wanted to make the bodies in Jazzercise seem both amazing and disturbing so I turned to violence and to camp. As I said with the Zelda and Isaac stuff, this is all there in the original text already, it’s just a question of what you can do with it and how you can transform it.</p>

<p><em>with a line from an interview<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say you explored caves as a boy,<br />
I think about the abandoned Sears catalogue homes<br />
I grew up with: watching them rot, heavy with secrets.<br />
What I’d give to go in that unreachable place.</p>
<p>Playing Zelda, seeing those doors on-screen<br />
that resided on the other side of a wall—why<br />
are there always so many walls? No matter<br />
how many games I play there are always</p>
<p>impassable places. Disappearing places.<br />
When McKenzie from down the street died<br />
I told my dad I was biking to his house<br />
to explore it &amp; he didn’t stop me. I biked there</p>
<p>but couldn’t go inside: those ripped curtains<br />
in the window, that sign on the back door<br />
with drawing of a gun that read: <em>If you’re here</em><br />
<em>today they&#8217;ll find your body here tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>I biked back home. If I was born a boy,<br />
would I have gone inside? Or were there caves<br />
in Sonobe that you were afraid of, too?<br />
You say that going back home, someone has blocked</p>
<p>the entrances to your caves. Does that stop you<br />
from going inside? I like to think I’ll go inside<br />
the dilapidated houses I see off the side of the road<br />
but instead I take pictures from my car &amp; try</p>
<p>to rebuild them inside me. It’s not the same<br />
as reaching your hand in a river &amp; realizing<br />
you’ve touched a fish but what else can you do<br />
in this <em>paved and partitioned world</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Age of the Empires Two, Age of the Kings: Loading</strong></p>
<p>We were in the age of empires.</p>
<p>We lined up trebuchets next to drag race cars.</p>
<p>We could walk through trees, on top of hospitals, &amp; knew where to swim to catch glitches.</p>
<p>We carried our worlds in our back pockets. They were holy items.</p>
<p>In the dark, we bent over them with flashlights, hoping for one more movement, one more glimpse—</p>
<p>We hovered around the computer, chanting the name of our world like an incantation: <em>Age of the Empires 2, Age of the Kings loading</em>. We loaded the kings into our bodies, invented our empires.</p>
<p>Underneath the stairs, we designed hover cars, theme parks, estates. We started our own businesses. Every Saturday, Aunt Sue made us chocolate milkshakes &amp; spagettios. We lived in a pantry of poptarts &amp; potato chips. We could be anything.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, we traded mythologies, &amp; there were no books to verify anything different. We told stories &amp; stories about the fish we caught, the men we shot, the civilizations we built in the back of the woods.</p>
<p>Once, we started digging a tunnel he said would go to the Annapolis mall. Every Saturday I dug while he drew &amp; I believed him, I believed him until one week I came over &amp; the tunnel was covered with a tarp. Uncle Tom said it got infested with rats &amp; we never dug much after that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in high school and needed my hair done, my mom took me to the Gene Juarez Beauty Academy, where I could get cut and dried into any shade of bad idea for less than thirty dollars. The academy students all had “stylist” names they got to choose during orientation, and they were read off in the morning at role call: Hope, Eternity, Esmeralda, Argentina, Belle, Ariel, Indonesia. I was 13 and didn’t realize that the names were made up. I thought these gorgeous sirens, with their black aprons and Marlboros, were destined for the beauty world from birth and named accordingly, the letters weaving DNA. I couldn’t put my hair into a ponytail or paint a smudgeless nail or get a pencil within an inch of my eyeball. Tabithas had no such destiny.</p>
<p>“Aurora,” the headmistress bellowed for a second time. My student stylists tended to be the late ones, apologizing a streak about shit-heel boyfriends and cancelled bus lines and radiator fluid. A Homecoming queen sauntered into the lobby. I stood up from the vinyl couch and sea of Lucky magazines, clutching my folded printout inspiration picture like a ticket.</p>
<p>“Are you Tabitha?” she asked, and then, “it’s so nice to meet you!” It was a Saturday morning and each mirror was taken by a woman trying to convey her vision to a trainee. Disembodied plastic heads stood at the ready for clarification. Instructors hovered on each row, correcting color mixes and scissor swipes. They came by to approve each plan of action before a student touched our heads—they played with my locks a bit, commented on the evidence of my cheap Kirkland Signature shampoo.</p>
<p>Aurora offered me a seat at her station and twirled the ends of my hair as she asked, “So what are we thinking today?” It had been six months since my last appointment, and my hair had grown past my shoulder blades and faded to a shadeless brown. At that appointment I’d brought a picture of Nicole Kidman from Moulin Rouge! cinched into a shimmering silver corset, snappably slight. I was built like a phone book. It would take a Guinness World Book record-holder to break me apart. I glanced away from my reflection, all stray hairs and frizz, my chin doubled up by the tissue paper they tie around your neck. I unfolded the printed page and passed it over.</p>
<p>“What is this?” asked Aurora, twisting the picture as if interpreting a Mondrian.</p>
<p>“It’s Princess Zelda,” I said.</p>
<p>“Is that a cartoon or something?”</p>
<p>“It’s a video game.” I’d found the Nintendo artist concept art online, the same picture they print in the strategy guides with the rounded edges and details that a Nintendo 64 merely suggested. Looking at the game now, in screenshots or Tumblr gifs, the discrepancy is insurmountable. Ocarina of Time’s Zelda is a hot mess of triangles and bad lipstick. But in 1999, there was little difference to me between illustrated Zelda and the Zelda I raced down Ganondorf’s crumbling spire with. The one I doodled into my geometry notebook. The one I dissected in fan fiction epics with all the dimension and depth that my teenage heart could hemorrhage onto the page.</p>
<p>“I…I don’t understand. What is her hair doing?”</p>
<p>I took the picture back, feeling my ears flush beneath my overgrown, ratty mane. “It’s long here in the back, see? And she has two strands in the front that curl.”</p>
<p>“What’s this?” She asked, tapping a French tip nail on Zelda’s forehead.</p>
<p>“That’s her crown.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm.”</p>
<p>“So I guess we need to make it blonde and then these front pieces curly,” I explained.</p>
<p>“All-over blonde?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Why had I even bothered to comb a bunch of Angelfire fan shrines for this picture at all, I wondered.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we can do that.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>She opened the bureau drawer, a piñata of butterfly claw clips and bobby pins. In the drawer’s depths was a L’Oreal color palette, categorizing the spectrum of natural human hair. “You see how you’re here, at Medium Ash? You’re wanting to change to blonde.” Her finger flew from the right side to the left. “Maybe even platinum. That’s, like, ten shades lighter.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“You can go a shade lighter, maybe two in a visit,” she said. “But you can’t just dump peroxide all over your head.” I offered no crumb of comprehension, so she continued. “It would be essentially like lighting your hair on fire.”</p>
<p>She caught my heartbreak in the mirror and took in a quick breath. “We could do highlights though, maybe? Then if you still want to go this blonde, you could do it slowly.” I nodded. “And you want, uh, layers in the front?”</p>
<p>“Pieces that can curl.” Zelda’s front curls were my favorite feature, the way they tossed in the wind whenever she was surprised, from that first fateful encounter in the Hyrule Castle gardens to Ganon’s final gauntlet. “My hair doesn’t curl very well, so maybe you could perm these two little pieces?”</p>
<p>“That…won’t work,” she said. “I promise, you won’t like that.”</p>
<p>Three hours later I was marginally blonder with Jennifer Aniston wisps framing my face. Aurora coiled the first few pieces with an iron to appease me, then handed me back the folded piece of printer paper. While my mom wrote a check at the front counter, I stared at myself in the front door reflection. The weak curl would melt in the rain like spun sugar. I’d go home and burn myself trying to recreate it and leave a strange scorched kink in its place. In a week of showers, the honey frosting dulled and sunk back into the medium ash. I tucked the printout into the garbage can next to the front doors. Even with a blueprint, I couldn’t become what I wanted to be.</p>
<p>When I returned to school on Monday, my best friend Emily met me at the bus. It was her new hair weekend, too. Emily’s mom took her to a salon in Puyallup, one with a lobby water sculpture and a wooden treasure chest of Stash teas. Emily was sold honey highlights too, but she fell naturally into a Golden Blonde swatch. She was tall and willowy and could twist her thick, wavy hair around her fingers and be alluring, instead of looking like she had some kind of compulsive twitching problem.</p>
<p>“I like it,” I said, and I did, but it was hard to notice that anything had happened. The graduated stylist had simply amped up Emily’s glory. She didn’t bother bringing pictures, and even if she did, they wouldn’t be of Zelda.</p>
<p>“Nintendo doesn’t have a single sexy character,” Emily declared when I confessed my hopeless crush on Link. How I’d corner him in the Kakariko Village windmill so the camera would glitch super-close to his dreamy eyes, and I’d drink up every drop. Emily had a PlayStation that cycled through Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy discs. Her heroines were rendered in shadows and grudges, secrets rather than legends. If she stooped to pining over someone on-screen, he would have to have a leather jacket. Tunics were gross.</p>
<p>“Princess Zelda is gorgeous,” I tried to point out.</p>
<p>“She’s an elf!”</p>
<p>“No she’s not!”</p>
<p>“She has pointy ears.”</p>
<p>“That’s not an elf thing. That’s a Hylian thing.”</p>
<p>Emily stopped talking and the argument was over. She’d won, because Emily always won. I was the smart one, and I might even be the funny one. But beauty was her sacred turf, and I knew I didn’t have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>That night I got home from school and tossed my Jansport onto the bed. I stood in front of my dresser mirror, my hair frizzy from the day. I didn’t dry or style it right, and by afternoon it went feral. A plastic Princess Zelda perched next to the drawers, her features frozen in carved China plastic. I pressed her sharp little curls into my thumb until they left divets. From my desk, amidst a hoard of Lisa Frank stickers, I found a Sharpie and a yellow highlighter. Carefully, as Zelda’s dead eyes stared on, I drew a Triforce on my right hand, and shaded the right segment gold. Wisdom.</p>
<p>When I wasn’t looping around Hyrule Field on Epona trying to bottle Poes, I was hogging our family desktop computer to write her story. The one I swore was in the game, subtext I effused into every trite text box word. How did you get past the guards? became “I’m a prisoner of my own privilege. There’s no tree in this garden high enough to climb, not a moment I’m not being tracked and inventoried.” I told my father about the dream…He didn’t believe it was a prophecy was a lifetime of being trained to stifle her intuition and intelligence, of watching men recklessly shift the world and deny her power. In Link she found her muscle, the means to her revolution. It was all there, but the cartridge was just short on memory. I transcribed it myself. Badly and unoriginally and cliché-ridden but sincerely, the first tremors of a writer zygote.</p>
<p>Zelda wasn’t just gorgeous, and she didn’t have to be sexy. She was smart.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s hard to remember, sixteen years later, what I found so mesmerizing about a graphically obsolete princess. I replayed Ocarina of Time last year on a Nintendo 64 that liked to randomly turn off, possessed by a Y2K poltergeist. When the drab, pixelated Kokiri Forest stretched across my 55-inch TV, I remembered declaring that “graphics won’t get better than this! They can’t. It’s, like, literally impossible.” Back then I could smell the moss and the dirt of the forest, the damp breeze rolling in from the banks of Lake Hylia. The jerky, jagged game was unrecognizable to the world I remembered spending dozens of hours in.</p>
<p>My recollections of Hyrule feel as unreliable as all of my high school memories. I’ve rewritten the narrative like a cassette tape, re-recorded with a hundred favorite songs. The tape’s unfurling as my fingers wind the wheels, trying to dial back to some truth on who I was back then.</p>
<p>Last weekend I was up at my parent’s house for a graduation. The gravitational pull of my high school was strong; I couldn’t stop looking around the corner, cracking open stories. “Did you know I tried to get my hair cut like Zelda once?”</p>
<p>“Oh god, you didn’t,” Mom groaned.</p>
<p>“Yep. I had a picture and everything.”</p>
<p>“That poor beauty school girl. I’m sure that was the talk of the break room that day.”</p>
<p>As I laughed off the past, Mom mentioned her massive crate of my drawings, craft projects and writings she’d held onto for 30 years. “Maybe you could take some of it with you,” she suggested. “I’d love to have my closet back.”</p>
<p>Armed with half a bottle of wine I tucked into her closet and pulled out my life’s work piece by piece. There were bunches of books made with stapled construction paper, an A- spelling test, tooth fairy correspondence. By the time I glimpsed the bottom of the Rubbermaid tote, my high school life began to appear. “Art class!” I said, lifting up a handful of sketches. “I forgot I was even in art class.” I enrolled senior year, after I’d moved on from asking for Zelda’s hair to Juliette Binoche’s French coif in Chocolat. On each sketch I checked the signature—is this my sister’s, or my brother’s? Memories tossed in the wrong box? They were actually good. Not run-off-and-sign-up-for-art-school good. But not embarrassing.</p>
<p>“See?” said Mom. “You weren’t as bad at life as you think.”</p>
<p>I unrolled a thick canvas scroll and found an oil painting of the Moulin Rouge, home of tiny Nicole Kidman. Beneath it, a thin piece of paper, already hamburgered in the corners. The rumpled page held Princess Zelda drawn with incredible care. Her dress was shaded in with colored pencils, much neater than I’d have the patience for nowadays. She stood with her hands on her hips and her head cocked to the left, that lovely mess of hair shaded to catch imagined light. A Zelda I’d only seen in my mind, frustrated at some unseen obstacle. She stared the mess down, straight and singular, a girl who was sick of this shit.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to look like the Nintendo artist rendering, I suddenly realized. I wanted to be this. The Zelda I had to make up because the game was too lazy to flesh her out. Strong and unflinching. Unafraid. My version of Zelda wasn’t the most perfect I’d ever seen, but it was the most beautiful. The smartest. She’s what I dreamed of becoming, a woman who could tackle her life with grace.</p>
<p>I tucked the portrait into my recovered Lisa Frank binder to pack safely in my suitcase. I may not have known how to look or what to do with my life, but I knew the direction I wanted to head, toward standing up and staring down. That girl had more wisdom than I bothered giving her credit for.</p>
<p>On the way out of the closet I caught myself in the mirror, my platinum bob almost fluorescent in the sliver of skylight. Two years of blonde baby steps into the shade I’d always dreamed of.</p>
<p>What the hell, I thought, and flicked on the bathroom light switch. I waited until my mom’s curling iron glowed orange, then wrapped my front tendril around the barrel. One, two, three. I let the strands free, and they sagged like a day-old balloon. At the end, my signature singed kink.</p>
<p>We grow into our legends, and we never change. Both stories are true.</p>
