								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Duke Nukem’s Peacekeeper .45 Talks Back, in Non-Heroic Couplets</strong></p>
<p>There’s no easy way<br />
to peacekeep, to hold back</p>
<p>the imagined terror<br />
of intergalactic creatures:</p>
<p>their foreign<br />
tentacles and</p>
<p>blue-skinned fists.<br />
Simply, I don’t have that</p>
<p>authority. Simply, I am<br />
triggered</p>
<p>by a white-man fingers<br />
until my muzzle’s dark</p>
<p>barking has quieted<br />
every target’s breath. </p>
<p>Damn. Why am I forced<br />
to speak this </p>
<p>simple barbarian? Why<br />
does only my tongue</p>
<p>burn with the gun-<br />
powdered spelling</p>
<p>of cemeteries? How did I<br />
become a singular</p>
<p>definition of hurt—<br />
as if my design</p>
<p>wasn’t for someone else’s<br />
profit? As if I’d asked</p>
<p>to be made into this cold<br />
shape of murder? Truth be </p>
<p>told, I’ve never known<br />
how to keep any</p>
<p>amount of peace<br />
within my loaded</p>
<p>frame. Truth be told,<br />
it’s not these bullets</p>
<p>I unleash at targets;<br />
it’s the rage</p>
<p>of never being given<br />
control.</p>

<p><strong>As an Adult, I Learn About <em>Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City</em> </strong></p>
<p>and after watching a 60-minute YouTube video of someone playing it I’m asking<br />
<em>what in the holyfuck is this</em> / Remember: Jordan didn’t allow himself to be used<br />
in video games / Remember: I’ve never played as him in my life / Remember: no child<br />
from my generation knows what it’s like to control the best basketball player on simulated<br />
courts / Recall: <em>NBA Jam NBA Hangtime NBA Live NBA2K NBA Courtside</em>, many more games<br />
he denied / Because MJ bought and owned the rights to his own character / Because this legally prevented any digital resemblances of himself / So the closest thing I’d ever come to playing as <em>His Airness</em> was in bootleg games / I can’t even remember / They featured white players on the Chicago Bulls with no names / A #23 with generic attributes / And I’m sure companies were sued for this / But imagine the shit-storm I felt when I first learned about this Jordan-approved Gatorade-endorsed video game from the 90s / And know that I’m a grown man as I write this / And know that in this game you can play as Jordan himself running around a haunted warehouse as he throws basketballs at robots with pink mohawks / And know that he high-jumps over booby traps / And he can even slam dunk on randomly placed hoops scattered across floating platforms throughout / It’s like a twisted <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> but with Jordan and pools of green acid you have to sky over / And the whole time he’s dribbling a ball and there are other NBA players who are somehow trapped behind automated doors / And it’s your job to save them / And to do this you select purple basketballs from your arsenal and throw them at different targets / And the purple basketballs explode into more purple basketballs / And when each level ends there is a bootleg <em>Jump Man</em> logo that emerges from center screen and grows bigger / And I’m not sure if I’m better off having never played this or if FOMO can settle in decades after something real has happened / Here’s my truth: the internet fucks me up / It lets me know everything I’ve missed and always wanted / Like a severe post-disorder / It gives me conclusions I don’t need: / 1) I really want to play trash games / 2) Jordan was and still is a Hall of Fame Douchebag who deserves to be dropped inside an actual haunted house full of acid pools and zombies / 3) I didn’t watch the full YouTube video but some online trolls did and left entertaining comments / 4) Search this game along with <em>Shaq Fu</em>, <em>Bill Lambeer’s Combat Basketball</em>, and <em>Barkley’s Shut Up and Jam Gaiden</em> / 5) Everything is becoming something else these days but I don’t know why<br />
or how or when I will unbloom and leave this all behind.</p>
