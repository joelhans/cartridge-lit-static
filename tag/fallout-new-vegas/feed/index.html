								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the Battle of Hoover Dam (Part Deux), ED-E floats behind me while I navigate the ramparts and depths of the dam, exchanging fire with the forces of Caesar’s Legion in their throwback regalia. Arcade follows as well, lugging around a giant bludgeon as effectively as one expects a pacifistic surgeon to do. He often falls unconscious.</p>
<p>After activating an army of killer robots to help liberate New Vegas from both the New California Republic and the Legion, I go to fight the remnants of both armies. The Legate and his fist-punching hordes put up a fight, incapacitating both of my companions, but I’m <strong>Annie Blacktop</strong>—I don’t really need their help. I rain hell on the Legate until he explodes.</p>
<p>When my companions revive, I head to the gate. A representative of the NCR is there. There are options of peace I scroll through, but I can’t take his bad attitude. Even though he’s surrounded by an army, he talks trash to me, personally blaming me for all the mayhem. After I’ve taken enough of his abuse, I shoot him in the face with the Rat Slayer, because I hate him. His head explodes in a spray of blood and, presumably, bone and brain. His men open fire and are immediately Swiss-cheesed by the army of robots surrounding them. I don’t even get to take aim. I admittedly feel some guilt, since the grunts did nothing particularly wrong.</p>
<p>The credits roll. It turns out I’m not a savior. I’m not a tyrant. New Vegas rolls on without me and I’m just kind of there. That seems about right. There is little sense of accomplishment because I don’t seem to care. My head hurts and my stomach aches and I have the feeling I’ve made a mistake. I should have listened to Leigh and Greg.</p>

<hr />
<p>I’m not someone for whom moderation comes easily. I eat too many slices of pizza; when I watch television, I binge-watch seasons of <em>Buffy</em> or <em>Arrested Development</em>; I run too far (and hurt myself); I drink too much coffee/beer/water; I take on too much responsibility; I commit to too many celebrations. It’s a problem in everyday life that gets exacerbated when I fall in love.</p>
<p>My first love was with Twix. Twix, to those who live in caves, are twin bars of chocolate plus caramel goodness. I got them for the first time while trick-or-treating in 1988 (I was dressed as Link from <em>The Legend of Zelda)</em>. At the first bite, I knew there was something special. The crunch, the gooiness, the flavor sensation. I’d never experienced anything like it. I had to have more.</p>
<p>I ransacked my bag for all the Twix I could find and then traded with my older brother for all the Twix he had (at usurious rates). When I finished, I piled all of my Twix in front of me. My memory indicates I had dozens of pieces; most likely I had ten or so. Regardless, I was prepared to eat when my mother walked in and said, “Don’t even think about eating all of that. You’ll make yourself sick.”</p>
<p>She must have intended to teach me a lesson, because she in no way enforced her command and I proceeded to force every stick of chocolate down my gullet in a frenzy. When I was finished, my mouth was covered in chocolate and my stomach bulged slightly. I wish my contentment had lasted longer, because no sooner did I finish than I bounced up, rushed to the bathroom and vomited everywhere.</p>
<p>Never again, I vowed. Of course, that lasted until the next obsession came along. Because, again: moderation really isn’t my thing. I get occupied, enamored, obsessed. In my teens, I discovered pot and spent the better part of a decade stoned. Just last year I spent several months buying and selling <em>GI Joe</em> figures from the mid-‘90s for no particular reason. When I discovered fantasy football in 2010, I spent dozens of hours a week poring over the waiver and reading essays and articles about how to win. I had a few years where I <em>really liked ties</em> and I now have a collection of several dozen (of which I wear five or six regularly still).</p>
<p>There’s often a penalty to this lack of moderation. Sometimes it’s as simple as throwing up too many Twix. Not a big deal in the scheme of things: twenty-eight years later, I still enjoy the occasional Twix. But sometimes the obsession has a touch of ruination. I played it out (like pot, or <em>GI Joe</em>).</p>
<p>Which brings me back to <em>Fallout: New Vegas,</em> a wonderful game that I’ll hear no argument against. The design is a small step up from <em>Fallout 3</em>, but a step up nonetheless. The colors, when not traversing the Mojave Wasteland itself (full of browns and browns and browns), are crisp and sweet, the controls responsive and intuitive. Crows fly at regular intervals. Water gurgles. It’s often quite lovely.</p>
<p>There’s dark humor and overt sexuality, sometimes combined. For example, when recruiting three prostitutes for a bar, I came upon a robot that I needed to reprogram as a sexbot. My avatar is a paladin-kinda gal, but when the option came up to “test it out,” I said yes, figuring that no one was around, so… I might not have expected much, but I really didn’t expect the screen to go dark, nor the weird drilling sounds that followed. A new notch on Ms. Blacktop’s bedpost, I suppose.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4.jpg" alt="NV_4" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4.jpg 800w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>The challenge is there this time as well. No longer is my avatar a God-person, dispensing total death with reckless disregard for safety. A well-armed room of grunts have killed me quick. So have the Deathclaws that roam the abandoned Sloan Quarry. The Legion assassins that pop up periodically have good aim and know what’s up. In sum, there’s plenty to keep my trigger finger active and keep me on my toes. It’s not difficult, per se, but it’s not a cakewalk.</p>
<p>There’s tons of quests, too. The big letters appear at regular intervals and announce the next mission: <strong>The Legend of the Star</strong>; <strong>That Lucky Old Sun</strong>; <strong>Young Hearts.</strong> Each one that arrives gives me a little Skinner Box thrill and makes me grin. I’m task-oriented—a lot of us are. There’s that sparkle that comes when we make a list and when we check items off that list.</p>
<p>Companions are easy to find, just challenging enough to recruit, and immortal to boot. No more reloading. They’re helpful, but not game-changers. They have their own story that can be unlocked. Fantastic. They could have thrown in a black or Hispanic ally, maybe, but from a gameplay standpoint, I don’t have any complaints.</p>
<p>There are factions to choose from in the world of New Vegas: Do we choose to ally with the Legion, which wants to bring order to the world at the cost of slavery and rampant, disgusting misogyny (spoiler: no), or do we want to ally with the NCR, who are good-intentioned, if a bit dumb? Or do we go lone-wolf? Or do we ally with the immortal floating head? We can only pick one. I try to join the Brotherhood of Steel, pacify the Great Khans, embrace the philosophies of the Children of the Apocalypse, befriend the Boomers, keep the Caesar’s Legion happy, join the NCR and even be chill with the Powder Gangers after I murder a prison full of them. Ms. Blacktop really is my avatar; she just wants people to like her.</p>
<p>My goal by the end game is a free state of Las Vegas, but that wasn’t always my goal; I’d initially wanted to become a part of the New California Republic, but I stopped short when they asked me to slaughter too many other tribes. The Great Khans? They sell the <em>Fallout </em>version of meth and crack, so I executed the entire Red Rock Canyon of them. But the Brotherhood? They ain’t never did nothing to me. Who was I going to execute next? The Boomers up on the remnants of their air force base? The Goodsprings community who offended no one but western cliché standards? Sorry, NCR, you have to go now.</p>
<p>The choice of alliance is the story of <em>New Vegas. </em>There’s some rigmarole of a platinum chip and <em>blah blah blah who cares</em>, but really, it’s about the fate of Vegas. It’s macro and grand, without being personal. It’s intricate for intricacy’s sake. There’s an intellectual, <em>I’m playing a game</em> sense of fun in pitting the sides against the other. It’s novel. It’s exciting. It’s kind of hollow. But it’s not the fault of <em>New Vegas.</em></p>
<p>The memory of <em>Fallout 3</em> and the magic that arose for me while exploring the Capital Wasteland was too immediate. I <strong>was</strong> Vanessa Rutledge in a way that I’m <strong>not</strong> Annie Blacktop. Part of that is the difference between political intrigue and the connection between a father and his child. But the other part is contextual and purely a part of me.</p>
<p>It’s no one’s fault except maybe mine. Leigh and Greg both warned me, in their own ways. When I finished <em>Fallout 3</em>, I talked to Greg. He’s recently married, more recently made a father, but he’s always available to talk nerd and is quite the gamer, even if he’s recently slowed down. I asked him his thoughts on <em>New Vegas</em>. I expected him to hold forth, but he just shook his head. “Why would I play it?” he asked. “I loved the first one so much, how could I expect it to be as good?”</p>
<p>“Everyone says it’s amazing,” I said.</p>
<p>He shrugged. “What if it’s not? Will that ruin it for me? I’d rather not risk it.”</p>
<p>Discomfited, I asked Leigh about it a few days later. Not that she’s a gamer, but she at least knows me.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you just finish the other one?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Well … yeah. So?”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and continued washing the dishes. “I don’t know. Don’t you want to try something else? You’re just in one of your phases.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have phases,” I say, knowing full well that I do.</p>
<p>A few days later, I naysayed their nayseyery and ordered <em>New Vegas </em>from Amazon. And hours after I received it, I fired it up. At first, all was bliss. But it wasn’t long before feelings of unease set in, much like it does after finishing the fifth slice of pizza in one sitting. And instead of stopping, I pushed through for another 100-something hours, sort of like (to finish the metaphor) if after that fifth slice of pizza, I went ahead and ordered three more large pizzas.</p>
<p>Trust me. The thirty-second slice of pizza tastes much worst than the fifth, even if, objectively, it’s made of the same ingredients.</p>
<p>There’s another parallel to ruining enjoyment. Back in the early ‘90s, I read a book called <em>Echoes of the Fourth Magic. </em> It was about a submarine that goes through the Bermuda Triangle and encounters adventures in a magical future. If that sounds dumb, it’s because it’s a terrible concept, written by a mediocre author. But as a middle schooler, it was truly novel and exciting. As an adult, I remembered that book, hunted it down at the library and settled in to read during the first hour of a blizzard. Not an hour had passed before I put it down and sighed. I finished it, but only because I had no other books. It was awful: poorly plotted, had clumsy, adverb-filled prose, scant character development, and was filled with cliché. It was so bad that it <em>tainted my memory of the book.</em></p>
<p><em>New Vegas</em> didn’t ruin my love for <em>Fallout 3</em> but my modest enjoyment of it had an unfortunate effect on my overall enthusiasm. Missed expectations and all. The double-whammy of overindulgence and the failure to live up to the highest possible standards plucked a heart string I would have preferred stayed unplucked. It’s so rare that, as an adult, I get so excited with a piece of entertainment that I want to drown myself in it, that when I’m disappointed, it feels extra keen. And I have no one to blame for it but myself.</p>
<hr />
<p>The thing about obsession is that, when the obsession wears off, damage has been done. Either to myself (re: cigarettes) or, somehow more insidious, to how I feel about the object <strong>of </strong>my obsession. It’s difficult for me to listen to Radiohead’s <em>The Bends</em> because I listened to it daily from ’00 – ’02. Similarly, it took me over a decade to sit down and replay <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> after I logged hundreds of hours back when it came out. I’ve hurt my appreciation to go back and enjoy something I’ve loved. And that is the tragedy of too much chocolate: you’re hurting your past self’s memories and your future self’s enjoyment and even your present self’s love.</p>
<p>Greg was right in his hesitation to play <em>New Vegas.</em> Not because it isn’t a stellar game (because it is a stellar game) but because he understood something about himself. He knew that if it wasn’t absolutely perfect, it would mess with a legacy he enjoyed. And Leigh was right to warn me to pace myself. She understands my tendency to burn my interests out with too much intensity.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1335" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1.jpg" alt="NV_1" width="670" height="419" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1.jpg 670w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NV_1-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></a></p>
<p>The thing about my obsessions is that they’re part of a never-ending cycle that has a tendency to hop tracks once in awhile. At the moment, I’m only obsessed with food, specifically bagels and lox. And I want to eat it for every meal. But, partially because I’m not much of a foodie, I’ve been able to withstand the full-blown temptation to indulge in it every chance I get. I’ll burn it out eventually, but it might take months instead of weeks (or even days). Because the other reason is that I’ve learned, at least a little, how to pace myself. I want to <strong>keep</strong> enjoying my bagels and lox, so I’m putting arbitrary limitations. I can only eat the ones I buy the ingredients for at the store; I can only eat one a week; I can only eat one after a large portion of vegetables. So far, it’s working.</p>
<p><em>Fallout 4</em> is officially released today. I want to play it so, so badly. But I won’t. For one, I still have an enormous backlog of PS3 games to play (<em>Mass Effect 2, </em>specifically, has been begging for me to plat it) and have no intention of buying a PS4 in the near future. But more importantly, I want to savor the experience. I’m going to wait until years have passed and my ache to play it has dissipated. And then, only when I have the time and the mental capacity will I plug it in and enjoy, once again, the wasteland.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Welcome to Retrogamer, where author and gamer Michael B. Tager experiences classic games for the very first time. Every month he will feature a &#8220;new&#8221; game and take you along for the journey, from old school to the newest of the new. Enjoy the ride.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>My wife, Leigh, looks up from her phone as I’m unloading The Terrible Shotgun into a Deathclaw. It explodes; she shudders. “What are you doing now?” she asks.</p>
<p>“I’m heading to those buildings there.” I aim the camera so that my avatar (Vanessa Rutledge, never just Vanessa) is pointed at ruins in the near distance. She’s got on shiny new Enclave Armor and is still rocking Button’s wig; she looks like a steampunk George Washington (only female, and black.) At this point she’s disarmed an atomic bomb, rescued all of the slaves, liberated Pittsburgh, rescued half-a-dozen cowering captives and given lots of water to dehydrated bums. If this were a different game, she’d have a shiny halo above her head.</p>
<p>She frowns, turns off her phone, and hikes the blanket closer to her chin. I’ve been playing <em>Fallout 3</em> for two hours while she’s browsed the Internet. This is as close as we’ve come to her watching me play in the past month. The counter says 100 hours. This does not include death time, reloads, freezes, and the time I copied the game to another account, played until dawn and then realized I couldn’t save.</p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/retrogamer_20150526_02.jpg"><img src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/retrogamer_20150526_02.jpg" alt="retrogamer_20150526_02" class="aligncenter wp-image-1077 size-full" height="771" width="1116" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/retrogamer_20150526_02.jpg 1116w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/retrogamer_20150526_02-300x207.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/retrogamer_20150526_02-1024x707.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1116px) 100vw, 1116px" /></a></p>
<p>“This is a weird game,” she says. “It’s creepy. This isn’t like those skinny things, is it?” She’s referring to the tunnels and the ghouls popping out of shadows. She closes her eyes whenever they’re on screen. She’s also not a fan of any of the raiders’ dens. The mutilated remains of torture do not appeal to her. To be honest, they don’t appeal much to me, either. I’ve avoided the subway tunnels for several in-game days.</p>
<p>I continue toward the ruins. I’m in the middle of the streets now, Star Paladin Cross and Dogmeat flanking me. I like Dogmeat just fine; he’s been with me a long time. Cross, on the other hand, has a tendency to die a lot, despite her fancy new Power Armor.</p>
<p>I miss Charon. He was dope.</p>
<p>“So, what is this place?” Leigh asks. I flick the map on and see what it’s called. The map—mostly explored now—indicates that I’m just northwest of the ruins of DC. “Um, honey,” she says, “why is it called Old Olney?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s based on Olney,” I say. We’re in Baltimore, fifty minutes north of DC and 30 minutes north of Olney. Leigh is from Olney. Her parents live in Olney. I might be grinning.</p>
<p>“Ew. Are you kidding me? Why’s it all destroyed?” Her eyes are wide as a pair of Deathclaws attacks us. “Ew! Why are those monster-things in Olney? Kill them!”</p>
<p>I kill them hard and leave the screen, but then get a message: <em>Star Paladin Cross has died.</em> I reload. I have a thing about my companions dying. Soon, I’m facing Old Olney again. I turn to Leigh and lift an eyebrow.</p>
<p>She shakes her head. “Can you not go back there?”</p>
<p>I nod, turn, and pad away. Soon, I hit the Montgomery County Reservoir. Leigh throws a pillow at me. “What the hell are you even playing? This game is the worst. I used to swim there!”</p>
<p>Laughing, I turn and continue to search the Capital Wasteland.</p>
<hr />
<p>I got my first PlayStation 2 in 2002. I got my first Xbox in 2010. My PS3 came to me last January, when my nephew upgraded to a PS4. It sat in my basement for quite some time before I bothered turning it on. After all, I was still knee-deep in <em>Ogre Battle</em>, <em>Ken Griffey Jr. Baseball</em>, and <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>. What did I need with a new system? When I finally pressed power, I just played whatever was already in there. It was <em>The Show</em> and I played for ten minutes as the Orioles before shutting it down. But I did not forget it was there.</p>
<p>A week before Christmas last year, Leigh asked me for some stocking stuffer suggestions—nothing over $20. I thought for a few minutes and came up with nothing. “Well, what about a PS3 game?” She rolled her eyes. Leigh thinks video games should have ended at <em>Super Mario</em>.</p>
<p>“That’d be dope.” Leigh stared without blinking. After 7 years, I knew what she was asking: if I want a game, I better speak up. I remember a game my friend raved about years ago. I was in school at the time, working three jobs and going on OKCupid dates. When I did play video games, it was in 30-minute spurts of <em>Dynasty Warriors</em>.</p>
<p>“Um. <em>Fallout 3</em>,” I said. Leigh made no comment, just wrote it down. A week later, I opened a gift from her brother: <em>Fallout 3.</em></p>
<p>“Did you want the Game of the Year Edition?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, though I didn’t know one existed. “Thanks. Can’t wait to play it.” I put it aside and opened my next present, forgetting <em>Fallout. </em>It won’t be until New Year’s Day that I think to look at it again. I will log ten hours and regret nothing.</p>
<p>That week, before I go back to work (I have fourteen consecutive days off since I work for the government), I play every single day. I do not look at message boards. I do not look at FAQs. I simply play <em>Fallout</em>. It’s been a long time since I’ve been into a game. I need to tell someone.</p>

<p>Here’s a test. Find a classic movie—maybe two—that everyone else has seen and that you haven’t. Then watch it. For me, it was <em>The Breakfast Club </em>and <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em>. I somehow missed them in the late 80s/early 90s and didn’t get around to seeing them until I was 20. They were good. Matthew Broderick was a cute kid, if smarmy, and Jude Nelson in <em>TBC</em> was badass. Afterwards, I wanted to discuss it with some buddies.</p>
<p>They responded to my overtures with dim stares. They’d seen those movies dozens of times. It meant nothing to them anymore. I wanted to deconstruct Molly Ringwald’s skirt and how Sloan was a figment of Cameron’s imagination. They couldn’t be bothered. They’d had those talks a decade ago.</p>
<p>It’s January 12, 2015 and I hop on GChat. I message a buddy, The Prophit. Transcript below:</p>
<p>The Prophit: How was Christmas<br /> Me: I got Fallout<br /> TP: Good game.<br /> Me: Yeah! I’m at Arefu. I’m trying to figure out whether or not to ally with the “vamps.” Or maybe kill ‘em all. I think there might be a way to convince them to be nice to the citizens of Arefu, though. But that seems like the way the game wants you to go.. It took me days to find it. I kept on getting lost cause I didn’t understand the map. Who knew that the empty triangle was pointing you to new locations! I didn’t! But anyway, what do you think?<br /> TP: Yeah, I don’t know what you’re talking about. George W was president when I played that. <br /> Me: Oh. So, what was your favorite part?<br /> TP: I’d rather not. Let me tell you about my Christmas …</p>
<p>Later, when Leigh walks in I’m in front of the TV, our cat in my lap. I ask her how her day was. She says it was terrible. I then say, “Sorry to hear that. Want to hear about my game?”</p>
<p>“No,” she says.</p>
<hr />
<p>Close to hour 120, I decide to trigger the final sequence. I’ve been wandering the map, collecting bobble heads (12/21 the first time through) and clearing out dungeons that look neat. I skipped the Dunwich building, despite the Lovecraftian overtones, ran through all the optional Vaults, cackling especially hard whenever I murdered poor simple Gary-clones and tried to overthrow Dave. But there’s a problem: I’m simply too strong.</p>
<p>Only once in the past twenty hours have I come close to dying (not including suicides from the top of Tenpenny Tower). I was minding my own business, collecting Nuka-Cola Quantum and murdering everyone in the slave camp of Paradise Falls when, on the way back, I encountered a trio of Radscorpions, one an Albino. It wasn’t a big deal, until Enclave soldiers joined the battle. I pulled out a flamer, took care of business and when, after everything was charred, looked at my health, was shocked to see I was at ¼ of health. <em>Fallout</em> had stopped being hard.</p>

<p>Is this normal? I wonder. Vanessa had completed all the optional quests and two of the DLCs (the boring Pitt and the surprisingly racist Point Lookout—really, black dudes in animal skins called Tribals?—come on). She had simply become too much for the suckers wandering the Wasteland. Maybe it was time to move on.</p>
<p>I pull out my active quests and toggle “Finding the Garden of Eden” and make my way back to Little Lamplight and the foul-mouthed little mayor who makes me giggle and traverse the tunnels capping mutants every few steps. It’s not until I get inside and actually die a few times to some Overlords and their fancy lasers that I start breathing heavily again.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m enjoying myself. I reload twice, fire Ms. Cross so she’ll go home and stop dying and continue into the depths of the lab. I’ll spend an hour blasting and cursing and making wrong turns. And it will be glorious.</p>

<p>Close enough to twenty years ago, when <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> came out, I played every day for several months. I lived, breathed, shit, and ate that game. A girl I was dating bought me the strategy guide (which was a neat thing in ’97). I played until dawn several times, sleeping the next day in high school. I was obsessed. When I finally beat the Airship Graveyard, I put the controller down and felt a weird wave of nausea.</p>
<p>I had made myself sick playing a video game. I didn’t play <em>FFT</em> again until 2014 when the visceral reaction to overplaying a game—a negative Pavlovian response—finally faded. This wouldn’t be the first time it had happened, nor the last.</p>
<p>Soon after beating <em>Fallout</em>’s main quest, I fired it up to tackle Broken Steel, the last DLC. I played for fifteen minutes and then felt a little twinge in my stomach. Recognizing the sign, I quit the game without bothering to save. I had to wait.</p>
<p>I turned the game off. I’d killed three Super Mutants, executed the cannibals of Andale, taught the citizens of Big Town how to use guns like a mensch. I hadn’t done everything. I hated the tunnels of DC and avoided them. I missed one quest in Underworld entirely. I hadn’t tackled Anchorage or the spaceship. But at least a wastelander saved himself from a Mole Rat using my Survival Guide. And I’d found Bryan Wilks a home with his sister. Not bad.</p>

<p>“Honey, I’m done with <em>Fallout,</em>” I call.</p>
<p>“Great, dear,” she yelled back. “You don’t want to talk about it, do you? I’m kind of in the middle of <em>Dr. Mario.</em>”</p>
<p><em>No, </em>I think. <em>I don’t want to talk about it. I just want to play more video games. I haven’t done that in a long time.</em> I’m a grown man; I work two jobs; I’m finishing my MFA; I have a house; my cats are demanding. It’s tough to find time to play games.</p>
<p>It’s February 9. I’ve played <em>Fallout 3</em> everyday for over a month. My school is ramping up again and I have to publish my thesis in four months. Valentine’s Day is in a few days and I haven’t gotten my wife anything. I don’t have time to play another game. I think.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t need to talk to you about it. But I’m gonna buy myself a graduation present,” I say, logging onto Amazon and quickly loading three new PS3 games onto my checkout. <em>New Vegas</em> is one of them. In my basement, I have stacks of un-played Xbox, DS, PSP games. I haven’t even played <em>Dr. Mario. </em>But I’ll get through them. After all, I really, really want to.</p>
