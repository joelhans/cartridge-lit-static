								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month, I was going to write about <em>Albert Odyssey, </em>a 1997 RPG for the Sega Saturn. It was the first game I requested—the first game I asked for after seeing an ad in a magazine for it when I was in sixth grade, and the first RPG my dad and I played together. It was the initial adventure that set us on course to navigate lots of dungeons together, share strange worlds, and absorb lots of narratives and memories along the way. This is my last <em>Save Point, </em>so I wanted to reflect on my first RPG as a kind of bookend, an honoring of endings and beginnings.</p>
<p>I’m thinking instead about <em>Final Fantasy X, </em>which does this in a different way. The first thing I wrote for <em>Cartridge Lit </em>was an essay on<em> FFX</em>. It’s in my top three favorite games, so I always feel like I have more to say about it. I’ve considered it plenty through a personal lens. This month, I’m contemplating it on a larger scale.</p>
<p>I’m wondering to what extent games can prepare us for crises—for crossroads with stakes that stretch beyond ourselves. I remember learning in middle school that Ulysses S. Grant wanted to be a math teacher before the Civil War started, and being really surprised by that, being really startled by it. I think this is because it made me realize that we all have multiple potential paths within us, and which one unfolds isn’t just up to us. We’re swayed and shaped and sometimes pushed by politics and global affairs and sometimes armed conflict. That sometimes our path is chosen for us. Later in life, I talked to a woman on a plane who said she wanted to write fantasy novels, but that she was studying political science instead because she thought she could do more tangible good that way. She said she couldn’t turn away from the problems of the world, and that she wanted to make a direct impact. Similarly, I met another woman who said she wanted to be a yoga teacher, but that she was studying environmental law instead. Obviously, there are lots of different ways to make a positive impact on the world. There are lots of ways to do good, big and small. Cultural and legislative. Publicly recognized and private and unsung. I don’t want to draw a false dichotomy here. What’s interesting to me is this moment when people see something they can’t tolerate and that overrides certain other paths. This moment when they feel called to something.</p>
<p>We see this in games all the time, and the games often make it look easy. Thoughtless, really. Those involved are just involved—there’s no deliberation. In <em>Final Fantasy X, </em>we don’t get to see Yuna, one of the main characters, make her decision to become a Summoner—in other words, to take up the power necessary to fight against an oncoming evil named Sin. When we meet her, she has already become a Summoner. Her father was a Summoner before her, and we don’t get to know if she grappled with the decision to follow in his footsteps or whether she always assumed this is what she would do. Yuna isn’t the narrator of this story, so though we see her struggle with the burdens that come along with the path she has chosen, we never know exactly how she arrived at it or what sparked her conviction. It’s a sad path at times, and a hard path. But she knows she can’t turn away from people’s homes being destroyed, from lives being senselessly lost.</p>
<p>I’m interested in this idea of what we would do if the world were a utopia versus what we choose to do in the flawed world we have. Games sometimes touch on this. After the big conflict is over, after the final battle is won, in the end credits, sometimes we see some kind of montage revealing what the cast of heroes does in utopian peacetime. Sometimes they get married, have children, become teachers, run businesses, travel, create inventions, make art, go back to school, or retreat from society in cabins in the woods. It’s framed as, “Now that the conflict is over, they can be their utopian selves.” But the world we have doesn’t work like this. There is never an end to the conflict. There is never a shortage of things we might do to try to make things a little less awful for somebody somewhere, even just one person. So sometimes, that reality numbs people. Makes them throw their hands up. And sometimes it makes them commit to a path where they can engage with what they see wrong. Again, these things aren’t easy dichotomies. Lots of people do both. Our stats aren’t set.</p>
<p>Because <em>FFX </em>is among my favorite games—because it’s been with me since such a formative age—I find myself looking at the world we have and asking, self-consciously, but also sincerely, “What would Yuna do?” Because our world isn’t tidy. It’s not so simple as, “Go into the cloister and prove yourself and then defeat the thing that everyone agrees is a problem. Use force and win and that’s it.” A group of plucky misfits can do a lot, but they can’t single-handedly save the world in a way that invites immediate utopia for everyone everywhere. And so many games wrap up on this plot point, and maybe that’s part of what makes them so appealing, but also what prospectively limits them. Given the flawed and complicated and red-tape-filled and often corrupt and bitterly divided world we have, what would Yuna do? How would she apply her good intentions? What path would she choose, were she not all-powerful? Were she just a regular citizen, one of billions?</p>
<p>I don’t say this to condemn games. Or epic narratives. Or hero stories. I think they help us dream and articulate our ideals. Dr. Rudine Simms Bishop famously states that stories—particularly books, but all kinds of stories—can be both windows and mirrors. They show us ourselves and show us each other. They show a version of the world. What we do next with that information is not prescribed; it is left up to us. Stories help open up questions.</p>
<p>Games aren’t always stories, but my favorites are. The ones I’ve written about here, in this column, for the past year and a half, mostly are. Maybe part of what I like so much about these games is, in fact, that they force me to face these questions. To ask, “What would your heroes make of our world, and what does that mean for how you should act?” A mirror and a window.</p>
<p>I started out in political science my first year of college and ended up in literature and creative writing. A direct inversion of the woman I spoke to on the plane. I hope that this is (and was) the right thing to do. That this is a meaningful path. I do believe writing has incredible power—the power to help spread ideas. Ideas are what motivate and justify actions, or help call them into question. The world we have is built on ideas. They shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Yuna would do if she were here, and I hope that even if in just some tiny way, I can help make the world better, through teaching, through writing, through small interactions in the day-to-day. I do think these stories we love so much prompt us not to be complacent—to keep asking what we would do if we could make a difference. Because in the end, we can.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first story I ever wrote was fan fiction. It was a mostly faithful transcribing of <em>Final Fantasy 2</em> (or <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>, going by the Japanese numbering convention), with the additions of inner thoughts, classic Adam West-inspired onomatopoeia (<em>THWANG! ZING! POW!</em>), and dialogue very clearly written by a ten-year-old boy, which is exactly what I was. Handwritten, 40-some pages long, it’s a treasured memento for my mother and a story I’m totally proud of.</p>
<p>Is my fanfiction good? Of course not. Does it matter that it’s terrible? Also: of course not. Am I embarrassed that I wrote a character, named Tageran, who appears ¾ of the way through and is suddenly the most powerful of all characters, with the most remaining lines? No: I was 10.</p>
<p>Not long after I wrote my treatise on <em>Final Fantasy</em> (inventively titled <em>Final Fantasy</em>), I wrote my second masterpiece, my own <em>Infinity War</em>, starring all of my favorite Marvel comics characters. Also handwritten—we didn’t own a computer until I was 14—this magnum opus spanned perhaps thirty pages and showed a complete evolution in writing. No onomatopoeia, no sudden introduction of self-named heroes, and quite a bit of death and destruction. If I recall correctly, it ended with the dissolution of the Marvel universe and four surviving heroes (Archangel, Hulk, Quasar, and Speedball) walking slowly in four different directions, into four distinct sunsets.</p>
<p>Sadly, the <em>Infinity War</em> is lost to time. Unlike <em>Final Fantasy</em>, my mother did not know of its existence and so didn’t save it. Oh well.</p>
<p>In college, I had some pretensions to writing, but did very little actual composition, so little that it dwindled to nothing for nearly a decade. But, while I wrote little original material, I was a frequent lurker and eventual contributor to two online forums: Planet Namek and Buffy.com, where I wrote several lost-in-time <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> fan stories.</p>
<p>I wish I could find those stories. There might have been something good in there.</p>
<p>In 2006, I came across a fan film that blew me away. And not for any ironic reasons, either. It was a film that was done purely out of love and looked fantastic. Sure there was groan-worthy dialogue, sure the plot was, at times, thin, but it was a labor of joy that inspired me. Of course, it was also a property that I adored. It was <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDxZkHCq4Tk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Revelations</a></em>, and I downloaded it over one of the last dial-up modems I ever had. It’s stayed with me ever since.</p>
<p>(I’ve also kept abreast of the developers of <em>Revelations</em>. <a href="http://www.trenchesonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some of them</a> are doing quite well. Perhaps the jump from fan-work to actual work isn’t as large as it sometimes appears.)</p>
<p>Watching <em>Revelations</em> was one of the key moments that led me back to writing and the arts: publishing, acting, even organizing theme nights at clubs and bars. Because even though it was within a property owned by someone else, there was such care and professionalism involved. It was the simple act of creating that inspired me. The venue of creation is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Fan fiction and fan development has long had a place in my heart. While I don’t tend to write specifically fan-based original stories anymore, to deny that I use my own fandom as a source in my writing would be a silly lie. Consider <a href="http://fortresspublishinginc.com/index_files/trb4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this story</a> I wrote several years ago while I was playing <em>Jade Empire</em>. The setting: a magical land based on Eastern myths and tropes. The plot and protagonist might be entirely removed, but the influence is apparent. And my appreciation of fan work never goes away. In fact, <a href="http://origintales.info/ultimatemasters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I seek it out</a> (the book linked there contains a mashup of <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Ramona</em>, as well as the best <em>Law and Order: SVU</em> fanfiction I’ve ever read).</p>
<p>Of course, the whole time I was watching fan films and reading fan stories, I was aware that there was an entire field of fan work that I never delved into. Fan hacks and remakes and balances of video games. Sure, I encountered fan hacks of video games (LAN parties in college of <em>Quake 2</em>, notably), but I never did more than dip my toe in. Call it trepidation or laziness or fear of viruses on my computer. Whatever the reason, I never bothered.</p>
<p>That is, until my friend Brian told me about <em>Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World</em>. I was dubious at first: <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> (or 3, depending on naming convention) was one of the first games I ever loved. It was, despite its age, almost a perfect game. “But,” Brian told me, “the people who hacked it fixed everything in it. They fixed the difficulty curve, the character-sameness, the broken AI, the broken spells. They even re-translated a lot of the dialogue.”</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy VI</em> debuted on the Super Nintendo in 1994 and blew me, and the rest of the role-playing world, away. It featured a larger cast, unprecedented customization of characters, non-linear gameplay, and a new steampunk world at a time when a North American audience did not expect such things (Japanese audiences were perhaps a bit more prepared). The story is both grand—an amnesiac woman with magical power is being chased by a malignant empire—and personal. Of the twelve main characters, each one is given a backstory and their moment in the spotlight, their own time to grow and move forward.</p>
<p>I spent hundreds of hours my sophomore and junior years of high school playing the hell out of it, exploring the world, poking my avatar’s heads into every nook and cranny. I remember the first time I found the Ancient Castle underneath the ground or the first time I beat Doom Gaze, the wandering monster. I remember the thrill of mastering the final Blitz, Bum Rush, or finding the Water Rondo, recruiting the two hidden characters (one obtainable only by allowing the party to be literally eaten). I mastered all of the mechanics and discovered literally every secret.</p>
<p>Every secret, but not every glitch.</p>
<p>As I said before, <em>FFVI</em> is an <em>almost</em>-perfect game. It has style, story, gameplay. The only mitigating factor in its perfectness is how broken it is. And it’s very broken. There are glitches everywhere, from walking through walls to beat minor quests, to exploiting bugs that play off each other to wipe out bosses with one-hit spells (Vanish/X-Zone), to making a character never stop attacking (the Psycho-Cyan glitch). There are programmed formulas that are nearly or entirely non-working (some of the stats, like Vigor or Evade, do very little) and special attacks that crash the game (like one of protagonist’s special commands, Sketch). It’s very, very easy to glitch the <em>FFVI</em> beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Beyond the glitches, there’s also poorly thought-out consequences of normal gameplay. The magic system is fairly intuitive. There are gems that the characters equip called Magicite. Once equipped, the characters learn magic. Easy enough. Except some of the spells are so absurdly powerful (e.g. Quick and Ultima) that once they are learned, they wipe out every enemy in one or two hits. Since every character can learn every spell, the end boss dies in half-a-dozen turns, owned entirely by multiple blasts of speedy characters nuking him with Ultima after Ultima.</p>
<p>For such a perfect game, <em>FFVI</em> is also kind of shit. Especially for replays; someone like me, who grew up playing it, knows every trick, every turn, every strategy. It’s hard to unlearn that when it’s so ingrained. Once mastered, it’s kind of not fun to play anymore.</p>
<p>This is why <em>Brave New World </em>was such a breath of fresh air. It fixed everything that was broken. And why I was so thrilled, so fanboy-ish, to reach out to the masterminds behind the hack.</p>
<p>According to one of the two mavens behind <em>Brave New World</em>, a gentleman who goes by the nom de plume BTB, “[<em>FFVI</em>] was good in the sense that it had potential. If you ask someone who likes it to think back on it, they’re going to look at it through nostalgia goggles. They won’t see the broken pile of code that vanilla <em>FFVI</em> is, they’ll see the game they want to remember it as. And really, the heart of this project was [me and Synchsi] just trying to make <em>FFVI</em> actually be that cool game we know it could have been.”</p>
<p>He refers, of course, to the massive editing and hacking he and his partner made to <em>FFVI. </em>BTB continues: “Names of items, how much they cost, who can equip them, spell parameters, etc. Like, 90% of [modding] is staring at a hole in a text document or a spreadsheet of character stats and setups and wondering if this one spell needs a buff or if I should lower this character’s speed or whatever. I just constantly put myself in the place of the player, look at the options I’m giving them, and think to myself&#8230;what option would I pick here? Is there a clear, obvious choice?”</p>
<p>The biggest fix that BTB and partner made in <em>Brave New World</em> was in the characters: their growth, their abilities. In the original (“vanilla”) version of <em>FFVI</em>, the characters all start unique and useful (a mage, a thief, a monk, etc.) but swiftly become interchangeable due to the character development design and the broken stat formulas. In <em>Brave New World</em>, that is all different. Only certain characters can learn certain spells and stat gains are all different for each one. So players have fast but brittle characters, slow tanks, magic users, and physical warriors, all of which have been tweaked to be useful. The re-balance required me to think, to plan, to figure out how to best use my characters. It broke me out of my hidebound adherence to rules from 20 years past.</p>
<p>BTB also says, “One of the things about <em>Brave New World</em> that I am most proud of is how every character is legitimately useful. Everyone has at least some player out there saying that they’re the best character in the game, which is what I was shooting for…I want to give the player interesting choices and the freedom to make them.”</p>
<p>That freedom to make choices is at the heart of modding an original game. The question has to be asked, though: why in the world would one spend time on an existing property? Why not create something original?</p>
<p>BTB told me, “Obviously it is much more work to create something original than improve upon something else—this is a fact that people who disparage the modding community like to throw in our face. But it’s more than that. We mod existing games because we see the true potential in them and we feel the world needs to see it. We mod a game to be a better version of itself, not something else entirely.</p>
<p>“I want everything to be the best version of itself. So often I am confronted with a busted, almost-good or almost-perfect facsimile of what<em> could be</em>. Maybe more time is needed, or more money, more motivation. In the case of <em>FFVI</em>, while what was created became an exemplar for the future, there was so much detail that could have been enhanced and tweaked to become just a little bit better.</p>
<p>“As a modder, I sort of feel like a quality control editor for the development team of a game. Obviously, I’m not the one who made it, but on that same token, when you spend longer than the original development cycle of that game cleaning up messes, you tend to harbor a very deep resentment. And that is tied to the real amount of work that I have put into it.”</p>
<p>That resentment is part of why we get so bent out of shape about the media that we love, when it isn’t treated with proper care and attention. The <em>Star Wars</em> prequels are obviously examples (while that care and devotions are what made <em>Revelations </em>so refreshing, despite its DIY flaws). But countless games have broken mechanics, game-ending flaws, or even aesthetic eccentricities that seriously detract from enjoyment. What I loved so much about <em>Brave New World</em> was that it rebuilt something I had enjoyed but knew had weaknesses. It shored up those weaknesses.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> is my favorite game. I don’t think it is, but it’s also not far from it. It’s in the top ten for certain, sometimes top five, depending on the day and my mood. But now that <em>Brave New World</em> is out, I don’t foresee going back and playing the original. Perhaps some people would, and I can’t blame them; there’s something to be said for canon and for adherence to a model. Me though? There’s a version that I think is superior, so why accept a substitute? It’s sort of like the song “Nothing Compares 2 U.” Even Prince admitted that Sinéad O’Connor’s version was better.</p>
<p>What I love most about fan versions of games (or anything) is that it takes the urge to create and refine art and uses it for sheer love. While there are occasions of fan art becoming mainstream (<em>50 Shades</em>, anyone?), generally speaking, it’s purely a labor without compensation.</p>
<p>I often wonder why I write about video games. I’m not getting paid, I’m not getting <em>direct</em> compensation from it, besides writing credit in a literary magazine. But that isn’t really the point. The point is that I love video games, and I love examining the whys and wherefores of games. I want to add to the mythology of games for others to hopefully nod their heads and be like, “Oh snap, I didn’t think of it that way.”</p>
<p>I’m not a coder, and I’m not a modder. I’m not really a fan-fiction writer anymore (though I do love the occasional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gronking-Remember-Book-Gronkowski-Erotica-ebook/dp/B00RN7TNHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan story</a> that crosses my path). But I am still a fan, and I’m going to add what I can.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year and a half, since writing <em>Retrogamer</em>, I’ve played quite a few games, many because I legitimately wanted to play, or because they were highly recommended, but also because I thought people wanted to read about it. And I gave them a fair try, but I couldn’t get into them, not enough to write a long piece about how much I hated them. I could barely muster the energy to finish an hour or two of these games, with one notable exception.</p>
<p>But, welcome to speed dating for video games.</p>
<h2><strong>I.</strong><em><strong> Halo 2</strong></em><strong> (Xbox)</strong></h2>
<p>I liked <em>Contra</em> and I liked <em>Goldeneye</em>. I even liked the original <em>Halo</em> when it first came out, despite minimal playing time (I was in college). I liked <em>Fortress</em> and all those early PvP games played on college servers. I fully expected to like <em>Halo 2</em>, especially now that I was giving myself time to really dig into it. But, I realized very quickly that I have better things to do than map out attack patterns for exploitation and the exact steps to run a gauntlet while following directions from some dippy AI named Cortana.</p>
<p>The crux of this is that I’m missing something with first-person shooters. I know I am. And Halo, for all the trappings of science fiction joy, is still an FPS at its core. And that core is not what I dig. It’s dying and resetting and figuring out exactly where the enemies are located. It’s repetition and brute memorization. That’s not a game; that’s like learning multiplication tables.</p>
<p><em>Halo 2</em> reminded me of Cecily, the sweet Filipino-American woman I went on a single date with. She was tall and lithe and had delightfully dirty stories; she had a good job and a lovely kid that she showed me a picture of. She also had a dagger-field of topics I couldn’t discuss (politics, music, books, her family, sports, the Philippines) and jokes I couldn’t make, because she liked being the funny person in the room. I probably could have figured out the pattern, but, like <em>Halo 2</em>, I simply couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<h2>II. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, I lived with Jason, a recovering heroin addict. He spent a lot of time on the couch, playing GameCube and often, when leaving or coming home, I’d hang out with him and chain smoke cigarettes. While I’d sometimes play <em>Mario Party</em> with him, mostly I watched him play <em>Metroid Prime</em> and <em>Phantasy Star</em>. I liked him.</p>
<p>He died a few years later of a heroin overdose. I found out later, through friends of friends, because I had moved out of the house as soon as I put all the pieces together. Why our money was disappearing, why his friends were using our bathroom for an hour at a time, why a cop showed up at our early in the morning for no particular reason. This isn’t strictly related, but it feels that way. <em>Phantasy Star 0</em> played like I imagined a heroin overdose would feel: slow, stultifying, mind-numbing, a product of poor decisions.</p>
<p>Phantasy Star 0 was half a hundred things warning signs, like platforming and weapon farming and minimal storyline. Warning signs I followed.</p>
<h2>III. <em>Final Fantasy III</em> (DS)</h2>
<p>Another victim of the blocky isometric necessity of the early aughts. What was the fixation with that crap? The load times that were put into the game in order to have these square-headed, lopsided monstrosities. Call me old-fashioned, call me a luddite, but I like my old-school RPGs, well, old school: pixels, cartridge-based, non-existent load times.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that <em>Final Fantasy III</em> is unplayable. I’ll track down a different re-mastered version and play that, one without 45-second load times between every single battle and dungeon. Especially on a portable platform, one that’s meant to be quick and easy.</p>
<h2>IV. <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>(PS3)</h2>
<p>Why didn’t I like <em>Mass Effect 2</em>? Why did I play it for three or four hours, put the controller down and simply never come back to it? I enjoyed the intro and the interface. I was engaged. It even felt like my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Sarah was a doctoral candidate in psychology, she liked <em>Dance, Dance, Dance</em> and <em>Kafka on the Shore</em>. She had an adorable cat and a 1950s time capsule for an apartment. All stuff I dig.</p>
<p>After our second date, after we kissed in her doorway, I went away for a week. And then she had a conference. And then with one thing another, three months passed before we spoke again. By that time, she’d started dating her old friends-with-benefits and now they’re married. I&#8217;m happy for them.</p>
<p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was, on the surface, everything I looked for in a video game. But sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes people and places and games slip away, one moment at a time, until, with a look around, there’s a realization that time has moved on and if there was a space, that space has been filled.</p>
<h2>V. <em>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</em> (PS2)</h2>
<p>This was disappointing. <em>Fallout 3</em> was what re-ignited my love of video games in the first place. I knew it was based on the <em>Morrowind </em>engine and modeled around the same open world, quest-based fulcrum that enthralled me. And I love high fantasy, so this was obviously a win-win. But it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Turns out I no longer love high fantasy—not without irony or deviation from norms. I didn’t even make it out of the first town. The spark that drove me in <em>Fallout</em>—the gallows humor and meta-reference—was missing in <em>Morrowind</em>. Without that, it was just a sandbox I didn’t want to play in.</p>
<p>I became friends with this dude Suleiman in my early 20s. We met at a country club where we were both killing time waiting tables. Me, I was waiting to leave for a year in AmeriCorps. He was waiting for his drug dealing career to take off. Of course, I didn’t know that initially. All I knew was that we got along real well, talked about girls and video games and smoked copious amounts of weed after our shift.</p>
<p>Before a shift, Suleiman handed me a vial of cocaine. I asked him why he did that and he said, “Oh, you try it out for free and if you like it, come back to me. That’s how it works,” and it was then I realized he was a proper dealer. And I remembered the times I gave him rides home and he made multiple stops along the way. And I realized there was no way we could be friends. I never told him, though. I just stopped returning his calls and when he asked to get stoned, I was like, “I’m good. I smoked earlier.”</p>
<p>Before I went to AmeriCorps, I heart through the grapevine that Suleiman was hurt I chose to not be his friend. I wondered if I made the wrong decision. Maybe I did, maybe I didn’t. Last I heard, he was in prison for murder.</p>
<h2>VI. <em>Star Ocean</em> (SNES)</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I would have loved <em>Star Ocean</em> as much as I loved its sequel on the PlayStation The mix of science fiction and fantasy (think the crew of the USS Enterprise goes back in time and is stranded on a world where magic works), the intense leveling system with dozens of skills to master, the combos, the blend of action and classic RPG. The vast world and frequent random encounters along the way to multiple branching paths.</p>
<p><em>Star Ocean</em> was close to what I liked, but it wasn’t enough. Not quite.</p>
<p>I lived at a frat house my junior year of college. I wasn’t in the frat; my roommates pledged and our house became the party house. It was whatever. I liked the free beer and I didn’t mind the parties, either the open campus ones or the smaller ones with the sister-sorority.</p>
<p>One woman and I became very frequent beer pong collaborators, running the table for nights on end. She got her name, &#8220;Moogle,&#8221; for skipping rush one night to play <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. When we discovered our shared love for the franchise, we tried hanging outside of a party, just to get some food. We both could have used new friends, but we realized that outside of video games and beer pong, we had nothing at all to discuss. Nothing. She didn’t read, I didn’t care about football, she liked school and I was there for the extracurriculars. Her major was one thing, mine another. Democrat, Republican.</p>
<p>It was the first experience that, yeah, I might like someone, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to be tight. I’d grown beyond needing just one or two similarities.</p>
<h2>VII. <em>Twisted Metal</em> (PS)</h2>
<p>I played the heck out of <em>Twisted Metal 2</em> in the &#8217;90s. I learned the ins and outs of all the vehicles. I memorized the courses. With one or two exceptions (I never learned to time the dune-buggy’s jumps and playing as a malevolent clown…no), I mastered the game. So, of course I was excited to try the original Twisted Metal.</p>
<p>Except, sometimes originals aren’t as good. The original <em>Mega Man</em> is basically a crappy <em>Mega Man 2</em>, with hints of a good game inside. <em>Twisted Metal</em> could have been a good game if the graphics had been better, the controls smoother, the handling tighter, the cars more differentiated&#8230; if it had been an entirely different game, in other words.</p>
<p>I went out with Keisha twice. The first time I thought I saw some potential, despite her talking on a cell phone for half of dinner. On the second date, when I saw her take out her phone despite, “Oh, I’ll just be a minute,” I realized that, nope, I was right the first time.</p>
<h2>VIII. <em>Metroid</em> (NES)</h2>
<p>I wound up dating this woman for a few months. Amy was a scientist, an artist. She laughed and taught, ran and painted, and liked <em>Guitar Hero</em> and loved travelling. I liked her. I met her dancing and thought, oh shit, this dating thing worked out. I liked her. A lot. Like, a whole lot.</p>
<p>I never got comfortable. I couldn’t relax. She was, to quote <em>High Fidelity</em>, “Out of my class: too pretty, too smart, too witty, too much. What am I? Average.”</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> was like Amy. Too hard, too complicated, too dangerous, too menacing. When health got low, that damned beeping sounded until either I either died or restored my energy. I lived with that beeping for hours on end. I couldn’t figure out the mazes. I couldn’t find the hidden weapons and passages. I couldn’t time the jumps.</p>
<p>And at a certain point, well, I gave up. I couldn’t get out of my head. I second-guessed myself. I stopped trusting my instincts and signals. I took too much damage, jumped around frantic. And then it ended, poorly.</p>
<p><em>Metroid</em> ended the same.</p>
<h2>IX. <em>Advance Wars </em>(DS), <em>Marvel Versus Capcom 2 </em>(PlayStation), <em>Civilization 4</em> (PC), many, many others</h2>
<p>Despite my anxiety, occasional depression, and frequent pessimism, I’m actually quite good in social situations. I know how to talk and bullshit; I have a few different degrees; I watch a bunch of movies, read books. I know stuff. I know what to take seriously and when to show irreverence. This is what made me good at dating, romantically or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the summer of ‘07, I went speed dating. Ten-minute dates played to my strengths and hid my weaknesses. I could reuse jokes and anecdotes and appeal to pop culture, surface-level attraction if there was no ready connection. “I don’t live in the basement. I live in the attic, Greg Brady-style,” I may (definitely) have said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I was asked about children. On a normal first date, I may have hemmed and hawed, but speed dating? “I love kids and they love me. The first time they’re bad, I hold up a single finger. The second time, I punch them hard, between the eyes. Third time? There’s never a third time.”</p>
<p>I was quizzed about my hobbies. “None, really. Mostly pot. And macramé.”</p>
<p>Not particularly hilarious humor aside, of the twenty women, I went on a few follow-up dates. None of them were soul mates, but we had fun times. And I remember them well, along with most of my single-serving or two-to-three-dates-over-two-weeks-before-it-fizzled-into-nothing romantic matches. I remember them, not because of regret or because one “got away,” but because, in one way or another, they all clarified exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>On a coffee date with one of the non-soul mates, Sara, a red-haired, zaftig doctor, genuinely surprised me with a casual insight. We were halfway through our coffee (you date enough, you start scheduling coffee instead of food to save on cash) when she sighed, interrupted whatever I had been saying, and said, “You know, you’re not my normal type.”</p>
<p>I sipped, raised an eyebrow and asked for her to continue.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re funny. I don’t like funny guys. And you work in mental health; I like guys who make more money than me. And also, you’re white.” Her fingers tapped the table continually.</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, I am white,” I said, lighting a cigarette and keeping my eyes from rolling.</p>
<p>She pounded the rest of her coffee and asked for a refill. “I exclusively date black dudes.”</p>
<p>I exhaled smoke rings and thought for a moment. “So, let me get this straight. You don’t like funny white dudes who are poor.”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“What about artists? Because I’m an aspiring writer, too.”</p>
<p>She sighed, “God, I hate artists.”</p>
<p>I laughed and signaled for a refill too. “Dude, I can’t imagine why you went on this date, then. Because if you aren’t into those qualities, I literally have nothing else.”</p>
<p>She bummed a smoke from me and we inhaled in unison. The check came and we paid. “Well, I don’t know. You have to try new things, right? We get older and we forget to branch out, you know? But sometimes you know you missed. I mean,” she smiled and put out her hand, “you weren’t that into me either, right?”</p>
<p>I refrained from saying anything that would make this conversation more awkward, and just nodded. I ignored the attraction I felt and pushed it down. Because she was right, besides the purely physical pull I felt toward her, I wasn’t that interested in her.</p>
<p>Until then, my 27th year of life, I’d almost always been after the story. It’s why I went speed-dating, why I went to random raves in warehouses, why I always said yes to whatever weird thing my friends wanted to do. Or I said yes to dates because she was hot. Or because it would look good on a resume. Not always because I enjoyed it. In fact, I would often say yes to events I very well knew I would hate. Because I wanted the story of how much I hated it.</p>
<p>And then, just as we were saying goodbye, she said something banal, but that I just hadn’t thought of until that particular moment in time.</p>
<p>She said, “I’m just too old to waste my time when it isn’t working.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A Plaque Upon Entering Dragon’s Neck Coliseum</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>War is the game above all others. And what is a game, what else would we call a game? A contest. A measure of who is best. War then is the measure of a man, a woman, a world. It requires all, like true contests do. It is an engine that takes as its fuel your blood and your soul and that of your enemy and it creates of it an ordered world. An ordered world. You ask a question of war: who is better? And war will tell you. War will tell you what remains. Peace cannot tell you that. Peace answers no questions. It is silent on every issue. But war speaks. It will make plain all matters, if you let it. No need for government, for freedom, for self. Step up. Place your wager. War knows your question already. No need to say it aloud. But keep it in your head, just the same. You’ll need it when the music starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Old Man of the Veldt</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[It’s about time. Blasted stove has been on the fritz for years, seems like.]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[Well go on, it’s right there. I’ll just take my seat. I’m waiting on the repairman, you see.]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[You catch that rider you tell him I knowed he stole from me. Tell him I want it paid back in tonic. I got no use for him to come around if all he does is poke his self where it don’t belong. Eh, say, you wouldn’t know anything about stoves, would ya?]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[Didn’t figure you would. I’m waiting on a repairman. Had that damn rider send a letter. He’s a thief, you know that? Says he’s a merchant. I used to have a wife. I used to have a wife and we used to brew coffee every morning on this here stove. We were so happy. But he come busting in one day, after, well. We did love each other so. Saw the blood. Broke this chair. Broke the stove. Clock. The midwife she told me to calm myself and find the down, but well. I had to get him out of here. You can’t let a demon linger. They latch onto a place. They fester. But he’d already broke everything. He broke it all.]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[You still here? Is everything fixed yet?]</p>

<p><strong>Duncan’s Tao</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have found my shape</p>
<p>It is best to use it</p>
<p>If the cup wished</p>
<p>To be the tea</p>
<p>What vessel could hold it?</p>
<p>So the mold</p>
<p>Cannot wish</p>
<p>To be the blade</p>
<p>So the teacher</p>
<p>Must remain empty.</p>

<p><strong>Interceptor:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I taught you: sit; stay; come; fetch; speak; attack.</p>
<p>What you learned: attack; attack; defend.</p>
<p>What I have learned: attack; throw; magic.</p>
<p>When you were a puppy, you played with my daughter.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not prone to obsession. In general, I can’t stand reruns. I’ve seen very few films twice. If you ask about my favorite book, the answer will change every time. I’m disinclined to favoritism, to fixation and repetition. This is why it interested me when, a few years ago, a friend asked what piece of literature I return to again and again in times of need, joy, or sadness—what story is my Bible—and my answer was <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p>
<p>Many people don’t care for <em>FFX</em>. The first of the series released on the PS2, they said it abandoned story in favor of graphics. They deplored the voice acting. They disdained the jockish protagonist. I agree with some of these criticisms—that laughing-on-the-cliff scene is truly cringe-worthy, and Tidus isn’t the deepest of heroes. Yet something about this game hit me, at age 15, just right. Right enough that 15 years later, I’m still inclined to write about it.</p>
<p>What struck me was Yuna. Something in me sat up and perked its ears when she first staggered out of the Chamber of the Fayth, exhausted but triumphant, affirming, “I have become a Summoner,” then collapsing, totally spent. Something in me noticed. Something in me related.</p>
<p>Like me at 15, Yuna was soft-spoken, polite, even pliant at first glance. But also like me, she contained determination. She had set out to do something she intended to see through.</p>
<p>Around 15 I developed two things: a savior complex and a sense of workaholism. I wanted to save everyone. I regularly pulled all-nighters, pleading with friends who had expressed suicidal ideation in five or more IM windows. A boy in my grade latched onto me. Followed me in halls. Transferred into all my classes. Showed up in my yard at night, begging me to listen. I didn’t mind. I wanted to help. The situation worsened.</p>
<p>In the meantime I delved into school, reveling in the fact that I’d been labeled a “good student,” seeing this as a path to some vague, uncharted glory. I added extra courses, getting special permission. I wore dark circles like medals under each eye.</p>
<p>Self-sacrifice and resolve: these were the things that drew me to Yuna, things I was seeking to cultivate in myself. I was determined to suffer, nobly, striving for goodness and greatness. I would suffer, yes. But I would endure.</p>
<p>Over the years I relinquished something of the self-sacrifice, losing all patience with people who asked to be saved, and realizing, too, the arrogance of saviors. This image, though, of the exhausted, triumphant woman, relentlessly carving out her quest—this stayed with me, even as years passed since I’d played the game itself.</p>
<p>In 2014 I began my dissertation in English, the most difficult thing I’ve undertaken. After breezing through coursework and clearing the hurdle of qualifying exams with immense but short-lived effort, the dissertation hit me like a sack full of iron. Trying to make work feel less like work, I developed a playlist of instrumental, epic music—including, of course, tracks from <em>FFX</em>. This got me over the coals of the prospectus, even as I self-consciously joked about it to friends, but progress slowed again in the spring of last year. After failing to write one word for four months, I decided I had to make the dissertation a game. I had to treat myself like a child—develop a system of rewards. The method came to me in a flash: eight proposed chapters, eight Aeons in <em>FFX.</em> The idea of a pilgrimage. My old, dusty idol. Once again, even laughing as I did it, I came up with a system of progress inspired by <em>FFX</em>. I had to try something. This was a start.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1528" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-01.jpg" alt="201604-kyle-01" width="400" height="474" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-01.jpg 600w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-01-253x300.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p2">I shaded a block for every two pages written, turning the isolation and drudgery of writing into a private quest. It seemed silly, but it built momentum. It felt fun. It actually worked. Remembering the thrill of visiting each temple, recalling the excitement of gaining each Aeon’s power, I increasingly found this a fitting metaphor for my chapters. After all, Yuna doesn’t <i>defeat </i>the Aeons; she convinces them of her worth. She coaxes trust until it is gained and the two can work together. That is the kind of metaphor I wanted for this process—one of <i>proving, </i>of <i>earning, </i>of partnership. What started as a flailing joke began to take on meaning.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1529" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-02.jpg" alt="201604-kyle-02" width="500" height="501" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-02.jpg 600w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-02-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-02-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p class="p2">In the end, the system proved so effective that I added a bar for Yunalesca to represent the more mechanical aspects of completion, things I felt I had to “overcome” rather than collaborate with—the formatting, the table of contents, the forms and forms and forms. Gearing up for my defense, I thought of Yu Yevon—the last, final boss.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1530" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-03.jpg" alt="201604-kyle-03" width="400" height="535" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-03.jpg 600w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-03-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>In giving advice to fellow students beginning their dissertations, I recently recommended taking up some version of the chart. To choose a metaphor that feels meaningful to them. As I verbalized this for the first time, however, elaborating on practices I’d found that worked for me, I realized <em>FFX</em> had crept into my life in more ways than one. I’d bought myself a hoodie with its logo on the back. I wore it every time I sat down to the growing document. I’d listened to my playlist so many times, I’d conditioned myself, Pavlovian: I cannot hear the first song now without equating it with work. Embodying this narrative became a ritual, steady as the Hymn of the Fayth.</p>
<p>I said this, even hearing the obsessive tone in my voice: “You must become the dissertation.”</p>
<p>Yuna, stumbling out of the cave. “I have become a Summoner.”</p>
<p>Maybe it takes this kind of fixation, of religiosity to complete this. Maybe this single-minded focus is exactly what I needed. A talisman. A rosary to thumb. Whatever the reason, I figured, it helped. “Becoming a Summoner” helped. Even though there are games I like better than <em>X</em>, this, for some reason, worked.</p>
<hr />
<p class="p2">Near the end of the dissertation I returned to my father’s house and dug out an old box. I was looking for an old drawing. I found it, and something else.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1531" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-04.jpg" alt="201604-kyle-04" width="1000" height="754" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-04.jpg 1000w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-04-300x226.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-04-768x579.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This was not the drawing I was looking for. But this is what I found. Something I’d completely forgotten I’d made, something I’d drawn in the grip of what I used to call an “Art Tantrum” when I was 23. I drew it on the inside of a box lid while working a retail job I despised. I drew it without drafting, simply stabbing at the cardboard in marker. I drew it as it came to me, on instinct, without question.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on in this picture. The three figures are self-portraits—at 15, at 21, and on the right, at 23. 23 was a confusing year, one spent locked in an engagement that was not to become a marriage. One spent faint as pencil. The middle is a year when I felt uniquely free—the magenta hair and grass-stained sweater are accurate representations.</p>
<p>The left, though shakily drawn, having no image for reference, is clear: my 15-year-old self as Yuna. Why I made this portrait symbolic while the others are literal, I can’t say. I only know it felt right at the time and that it stirred something in me when I found it last winter, lifting it out of the box.</p>
<p>“See!” I told my husband excitedly. “I was a Summoner even then!”</p>
<p>The gist of the image, of course, is the disparity between the goodness I felt at 15 and 21 and the emptiness I felt at 23. While melodramatic, it was affirming—proof of the emotions that drove decisions I later made. In particular, though, what interests me now are the words surrounding my Yuna-self.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A profound sense of purpose. Graceful but strong. Well-earned oasis. A mission.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was these qualities that drew me to Yuna as much as any measure of self-sacrifice. The first time I played the game, would you believe I was a little disappointed that she didn’t die? That she defies the myth of Spira and lives, upending her tragic fate? Enraptured by the image of a self-destructing woman, a part of me felt cheated, even as other parts rejoiced. Regardless, what shone through then and kept my interest piqued was her resolve, her sense of purpose. The antithesis of sloth, she would not rest until her task was finished. Admiration and desire for this quality are what carried my feet to grad school, whether I realized it or not. Yuna was there all along, though she’d seemed like a relic who’d emerged at the dissertation stage: a last-minute, real-world power-up. The box lid in my hands gleamed like a dot, connecting me to past, more recent past, and present. A continuous thread in my life, the constellation of an arrow ushering me forward.</p>
<p>And in fact, this continuity is more pervasive than I realized even then. In 2011, after learning about literature’s historical propensity for funneling female characters into compulsory weddings or death, I presented a conference paper on contemporary media that do not succumb to this trend. It included <em>FFX</em>—for many reasons, but most of all for the scene where Yuna appears trapped between toxic matrimony and suicide, but finds escape from both. A scene that was instrumental as I contemplated options during my own, similar escape. That enabled me to live and to find a healthy love.</p>
<p>In 2014, that essay was published as part of an anthology on modern female heroes. I knew this. I knew. Yet I still laughed self-consciously when printing my Aeon chart.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1532" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-05.jpg" alt="201604-kyle-05" width="400" height="213" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-05.jpg 400w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/201604-kyle-05-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>I am not prone to obsession, but I cannot deny this thread, this vein that sings like Fayth. There is something to this—a touchstone, a guidepost. A reminder of one’s soul, yet also a reminder that one’s soul is mercurial, fluid rather than fixed. Yuna, for me, has been a palimpsest—a character on whom I’ve written again and again, turning her, prism-like, spilling light through her various faces. Self-abnegating martyr. Determined introvert. Marriage resister. And yet, love-seeker. When my friend asked of my secular Bible and I answered <em>FFX</em>, it leapt to mind because it is one of the only games I have actually played more than once. Each time, I see now, I was observing new things, relating in new ways. Sometimes projecting parallels of triumph, other times of survival.</p>
<p>Perhaps what caught me so off guard about the effectiveness of the Aeon chart is the admission it necessitates: that though Yuna comes from a game with awkwardness aplenty, she comes too from a myth that infuses my actions, a narrative wound around me. She is something that sings throughout my life, resounding through temple and journey.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>I. EXP</strong></em></p>
<p>There is a cycle to this wandering. The woods, the wells, the grasslands, the towns, the monsters, the bandits, the thieves. Your rusting weapons and armor, your tired bones.</p>
<p>As a child you were never warned about the cost of being a warrior. There is no end to your journey. You win and it is not enough and you kill and it is not nearly close to enough.</p>
<p>When the stars reveal to you that you are the one, you have no idea of the calamity that is to come. They give only ethereal voices to command you, and an endless sea of obstacles set before you to kill. Only the piling on and piling on of the world upon your shoulders until you are more earth than man.</p>
<p>The more you slaughter, the greater you become, until you are like death itself. Downing mobs with quick slashes, quelling the perpetual onslaught of destruction that spawns in your path. And after all this, the fates gift you more death.</p>
<p><em><strong>II. PAUSE &#8211; NEW GAME</strong></em></p>
<p>You have been drifting in this void for a short millenia. Stuck somewhere between the conclusion of your journey and the beginning, only the end and the start are intertwined, and upon finishing one, you appear again at the other. Your youth restored, your strength stripped from you, along with your scars. Again, the fates sing. Again.</p>
<p><strong><em>III. BATTLE</em></strong></p>
<p>You watch your friends and allies die. You revive them. You see the wear of war and turmoil build upon them, change them. Watch them mourn for you as you lose yourself in a hemorrhage of life and blood, only to wake at the start of the middle. Memories wiped, wounds reversed. Your battle unfought.</p>
<p><strong><em>IV. GAME OVER</em></strong></p>
<p>When you fail, the world ends. Blinks out into a flat darkness. If you lose, you will not go on. You die. This is the only option. And if you die, your entire universe ceases.</p>
<p>You carry the fragile heart of the world in your hands.</p>
<p><strong><em>V. PATH</em></strong></p>
<p>You are given infinite chances at revival, infinite gifts from the universe that have constructed you, but you are given no option to stray. You cannot drift the course or wait the day. You cannot leave, much as you try.</p>
<p><strong><em>VI. PC</em></strong></p>
<p>The unknown compels you to act, to move and to defeat and to solve. You stave off the death of your world one kill at a time. You move because your body commands you to. You will die and you will fight and you will live. You will scar and you will be scarred. You will finish this journey if it tears you to pieces.</p>
<p>You must, because you are the hero.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He was sad, but he had a right to be. Saw him first standing in the shadow of Alexandria&#8217;s sword. Strange to think how Alexander was gone though the city kept on living, even after decimation. We built it back. Not me personally, but I watched how everyone still living came together to remake what was stolen, all that we had lost.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I first saw him.</p>
<p>The war may have ended but not in the hearts of Alexandrians. Even without the Mist and the way the continent opened up, the way peace found its way finally into our world, he was still a symbol of our annihilation. His flopping mage hat, his long blue coat, and that strange abysslike opacity to his skin. Everyone kept their distance and I think that&#8217;s why he wasn&#8217;t using his magic to help dig through the rubble or build. I&#8217;d never seen a mage do anything by hand, but there he was, his frail body working tirelessly to help the city he watched fall apart. He could&#8217;ve been sitting with his friend, the Queen, but he was down here in the mud and wreckage with the rest of us. He didn&#8217;t say much of anything. He would work long after everyone left for the pubs and by the time work began he had been working for hours.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the kind of person he was. And that&#8217;s why I approached him in the Morning Star Bar when he showed up.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time there, truth be told. Most people did. In fact, it was one of the first places rebuilt. You know there are those who think the agrarian revolution began because we wanted to make alcohol? I can&#8217;t speak to the truth of that, but I know that wine, spirits, and ale bind us together as a civilisation. We drank a lot before the Queen returned because, I mean, it was the end of the world, yeah? We saw the gods fighting and some of them killed. When the sky opens up raining down Death, you don&#8217;t just sit around and live your life like it&#8217;ll last forever. No, we lived like every moment was the last, and we drank and fucked, screaming and fighting just hoping to keep the sky above us.</p>
<p>And although life was safe, the adrenaline of the apocalypse was still in us, or maybe just that the world had changed so much so fast caused us to keep living recklessly.</p>
<p>At any rate, when he walked in you could hear how the room silenced, how fear ran through us, running electric over our bodies. He walked to the back corner of the Morning Star alone and drank black ale in the shadows. Maybe I was just drunk enough to not give a shit what others thought or how dangerous this might have been.</p>
<p>I sat down across from him, my drink sloshing onto the table.</p>
<p>Hello, I&#8217;m Vivi, he said. His voice was higher than I expected and it sounded like he smiled. Impossible to tell, staring into the blackness of his face.</p>
<p>Everyone calls me Knife.</p>
<p>He nodded, I had a friend who went by Dagger. Here, let me get you a drink.</p>
<p>Vivi caught the waitress as she walked by and I order a pint of pale. I thanked Vivi, my words probably slurring out my mouth.</p>
<p>He sipped at his beer and said, I love this place.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>He nodded, I know what people think, but it&#8217;s okay. I do love this place. I always have, and I hope I can see it returned to glory before I leave this world.</p>
<p>My beer arrived; the lukewarm liquid filled my stomach.</p>
<p>Would you like something to eat, too?</p>
<p>I probably should.</p>
<p>He laughed, a high ringing tone, I&#8217;ll get us something when she comes by next.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it feel like doing magic?</p>
<p>He blinked and heat ran through me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I said, I didn&#8217;t, I mean, it&#8217;s not my business.</p>
<p>He raised a hand and giggled, No, not that. It&#8217;s just, no one&#8217;s ever asked me about magic. I know what everyone thinks and the way they look at me. To most, magic is a sign of destruction. They&#8217;re right to think that. I saw what the black mages did to the world. I fought many of them. I know what I am to everyone who looks upon me. I&#8217;m anathema, a harbinger. I&#8217;m Death incarnate. Probably millions of Alexandrians only see the Deaths of their friends and families when they see me walking by. So it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>He gulped down half of his beer, But magic. Well, it—how to describe it? It&#8217;s like something extra in the air. You know how you smell and see and hear the world? Well, magic is a shimmering glaze spread over aspects of reality, but it also doesn&#8217;t really exist anywhere. When I do magic, it&#8217;s a pulling and weaving that happens.</p>
<p>I must&#8217;ve been staring blankly because he just kept talking.</p>
<p>So, okay. You see reality as a single layer, but it&#8217;s really several. Imagine a sandwich. We all see the top layer of bread, and that&#8217;s reality as we know and experience it. Magic exists in the layers beneath. The meat, the tomatoes, the lettuce, the bottom piece of bread: that&#8217;s where magic exists. But it&#8217;s more complex than that. It&#8217;s more like a thousand threads winding and twisting beneath the surface. To perform magic, I reach down into those other layers of reality and tug on the threads. By pulling them into this reality, I&#8217;m able to make fire or ice or lightning or water or anything else. Summoners, like the Queen, can call forth the gods who live there, which is what you saw when Alexandria was destroyed. White mages and blue mages reach down into the same layers. It&#8217;s my curse that I only see the threads of destruction, and so I rarely perform magic these days. It&#8217;s not just because how afraid everyone is. It&#8217;s because there&#8217;s no place for black magic in this world of peace.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re amazing, I said and wished I hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The waitress arrived and Vivi ordered us sausage, bread, and cheese. While he ordered, I sidled next to him.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because he was so kind and gentle and innocent. Maybe it&#8217;s because I was drinking too much and hadn&#8217;t eaten anything all day. Maybe it was because he smelt like cinder and smoke, like danger, like destruction. Or maybe it was just because I was horny and lonely and the world still felt like the apocalypse, but I wanted him.</p>
<p>I want you.</p>
<p>He choked and scooted from me, Um, what? No, it&#8217;s—we can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I want to feel that blackness inside me. I want you to fill me with magic. I want to taste the Death you carry within you.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed and he got out of the booth, Miss Knife, what you ask is impossible and I won&#8217;t speak to you about this anymore.</p>
<p>He spun to leave and I grabbed his sleeve, Please, Master Vivi, just stay and talk.</p>
<p>Staring at his back, tears filling my eyes that I couldn&#8217;t explain, his body quaked as if seething with that unknowable energy coursing through him. Please, just talk to me, I said.</p>
<p>Sitting down across from me, his eyes still thin but luminous, his voice flat, I enjoy talking but there will never be any love of that kind between us. Though I live, I&#8217;m not a man.</p>
<p>They say that you&#8217;re—sorry.</p>
<p>Dolls. I know. I&#8217;ve heard them. I&#8217;ve seen the thousands of black mages who are only dolls. Very few of us escaped the fugue of our design, and only I remain.</p>
<p>You seem lonely, I reached and touched his gloved hand.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes but didn&#8217;t take his hand away, I&#8217;ve lost a great deal and I have so little time. My friends are all so busy or gone. Zidane. I see him smiling at me still. I saw him die, but I don&#8217;t believe it. Not really. He and Kuja were so intertwined—but you don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m talking about. I am lonely, I guess. It&#8217;s hard not to be. I&#8217;m the last of my kind, and we existed so briefly. Humans fear me, for good reason, but I live and I try to live well. When I rejoin the memories of the world, I hope to bring my brothers new sights and sounds. Mostly I hope to heal the world. I want to reverse the evil done by my kind and in our name. I want to spread happiness. I want to be warm light shining over the faces of everyone I&#8217;ve ever known or will ever see.</p>
<p>The food arrived and we didn&#8217;t say much after that. I don&#8217;t really remember how the food tasted though I ate almost all of it. I don&#8217;t think he actually needs to eat, and I don&#8217;t think he had to pay. We sat together for probably an hour and the more I stared at him, the hornier I got. He emanated this immense sadness crashing into me like waves. I thought it might have been magic, his power just accidentally spilling forth from his body. That beautiful blackness covering his body—the more I stared the more I realised it wasn&#8217;t his skin. No, it was like this veneer over whatever lay beneath. I was seeing only the smoke of the maelstrom but none of the flames.</p>
<p>He left and hugged me. I held him a long time, feeling his tiny powerful body surging into me, tasting the cinder and smoke.</p>
<p>He remained in Alexandria for a few months and we saw each other occasionally but we never talked again. Just greetings and goodbyes. He kept working, kept trying to help, but a quivering fear followed him, like the shadow he cast was filled with the Deaths of all we once knew.</p>
<p>I hope he found happiness before he stopped.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holding onto his large hat flapping in the wind, his coat wrapped tight round him, Vivi stared out into the ocean seeing only the waves rolling past the Alexandrian ship and crashing into the shore. Clouds closed over the sky and the waves lapped at the boat Vivi rode to shore. Pulling his gloves tight, he dragged the boat further up the shore, out of tidereach.</p>
<p>The horizon disappeared behind distant storms and Vivi entered the forest. Walking slow, he pushed back the brim of his hat and listened to fill himself with the songs of the world. The sounds of the forest warbled against the wind, the song of a thousand cicadas always chirping, of skittering mammals and chirping birds filling him, pulsing his skin electric. The forest floor covered in leaves and he trampled through them, the winds ripping autumnal leaves from skeletal boughs. Birds sang in the trees and he watched them, sighing, and they flew away. Resting under an enormous tree when the rains came, he pulled fire into the air, rolling it between his hands as it grew and expanded. The rain sizzled against the blaze and he slapped his hands together, erasing the flame.</p>
<p>Waiting for the storms to pass, he looked up into the greyed sky and shrugged, pulled his hat down tight, fastened his coat, and wandered into the rain falling between the branches. He stopped a moment later, looked at his hands, clenched his fists, then waved them over his head, creating a barrier between him and the rain, which ran off the barrier like an umbrella.</p>
<p>Alone, he took his time, paying attention to all that he passed, every fallen leaf, every standing tree, every gust of wind, and every glimpse he caught of animals. He smiled seeing the animals he fought so long ago&#8211;the griffins, the zaghnols&#8211;resting beneath the boughs of the enormous trees, doing whatever it took to stay dry. Their young crowding together around them, he stopped and stared, warmth growing in his chest then spreading to his limbs. Not the warmth of the pyre raging always in him, but the warmth of friendship, of Zidane&#8217;s smile or Steiner&#8217;s kind words.</p>
<p>The forest declined, the trees and undergrowth thinning, the earth beneath his feet hardening. The trees lost their leaves and the winds blustered by, the rains slashing against his barrier. The bark appeared as stone or granite, calcifying, and everything became dead.</p>
<p>The trees, dead in their roots, dead in their branches, the grass turned to rot, and the rot turned to rock. Dead so long it named the place: the Dead Forest. Death spread round him and the air emptied of sound, his breath lost heat, and his eyes lost their glow. Death seeped into everything and a weight pulled on him, dragging him down, stealing the breath from his lungs, the energy from his limbs. He blinked and his eyelids hung low, his body drooping with every step. The labyrinth of empty paths echoed with his steps and the winds ripped through, emptying him. He hummed to fill himself, to contain his body and keep moving. His humming echoed against the barrier and became the only sound against the slapping waves of rain.</p>
<p>The maze of the Dead Forest managed easily, Vivi&#8217;s eyes ran over the cracks in the bark, in the earth. He came upon a sapling, a single stream of green stretching to the sky from the dead ground. Only a few centimetres in height, and Vivi&#8217;s voice caught in his throat, his eyes welling, the ocean inside him bursting against the limitations of his body.</p>
<p>Life, he said, Even after Death.</p>
<p>He dropped the barrier keeping him dry and watched the water coursing round the only living creature growing in the Dead Forest.</p>
<p>At the edge of the Dead Forest and the Black Mage village, Vivi stared at the blanket of grey spread above in all directions. The rains ended but night descended, and the silence of the Dead Forest remained.</p>
<p>He took the steps from the forest into the village. No one wandered the paths and no lights shone in the houses. Vivi looked for signs of activity but found only remnants of the past. Entering the inn, he found only dust and cobwebs, insects taking over the storerooms and beds. The blacksmith and armory were the same&#8211;covered in dust, in cobwebs, in silence.</p>
<p>Hello, he bellowed into the emptiness of the streets, against the nothingness of the greyed sky.</p>
<p>The only response was the wind, cutting through as the silence crushed him, as if gravity increased exponentially where he stood.</p>
<p>Dragging his feet to the graveyard, he collapsed to his knees, falling to his hands, unable to look at what spread before him.</p>
<p>Piled on top of each other, hundreds of black mages, all stopped, never to move again.</p>
<p>Vivi wept in the drying mud of the village, not looking at those like him who no longer lived.</p>
<p>As the grey clouds separated revealing the blackness of night, Vivi stood and pressed his palms together in front of his chest. Spreading slowly, a flame sparked and grew as he spread his arms. He pushed the flame above his head and then pushed up, the fire growing to an inferno above his head, battering against the darkness. A dragon of fire, its wings of light spreading over the city, and it breathed those funereal flames into the sky, blotting out the stars. Light spread over the city, dancing against the shadows, eradicating them. His body quaked, pouring all his energy into the flame lapping against the sky. His chest heaving, he threw the fire into the graveyard and burnt the hundreds of black mages away.</p>
<p>In the crackling of their cindering bodies, a song spilt into the night. He listened, their memories dancing into his ears, reverberating through his skull, crackling beneath his skin.</p>
<p>It happens so fast, he said. Don&#8217;t be afraid of dying, of being dead. Soon I&#8217;ll join you. It&#8217;s already been a year since I found myself awake and thinking, since I met grandpa. I can&#8217;t have much longer. Wait for me, brothers. I used to wonder if we existed at all, if we were even real. But I know now that we are. Our lives matter, and when we die, we&#8217;re uniting with all the memories of Gaia, just like everyone else, everything else. We matter and we&#8217;re real. I&#8217;m not sorry you died. I won&#8217;t be. I&#8217;m sorry that I must live on without you. I came so far just to see you all again, just to live with all of you, but you expired too soon. I won&#8217;t hold it against you. It&#8217;s not your fault. I don&#8217;t know how much time I have left, but I promise to do as much as I can, so I can bring you new places, new stories, memories you&#8217;ve never had. Sometimes it feels like a curse that we exist so briefly, but that&#8217;s part of our advantage. We love deeper, we run faster, and we take in every moment. We breathe in every image, every scent, every single second and we keep it sacred, safe. On the way to see you I found life sprouting in this dead and dying land. The world&#8217;s changing, and though we won&#8217;t be here for what comes next, it fills me with hope. I watched Atamos kill Alexander and Garland murder the gods themselves. I watched Kuja rage against life and light, hoping only for annihilation, and then the god of Death&#8211;I hope you didn&#8217;t fear dying the way I do. I&#8217;m working on it, but it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard to look around at the world and accept that it&#8217;ll live so long past us. I&#8217;m afraid of leaving life but I&#8217;m working to accept it. I&#8217;m trying to be better, trying to learn to just be.</p>
<p>Vivi listened again to the songs of the dead mages filling the empty village, echoing against the blackened sky. The memories of the black mages filled him and visions of their lives projected against the surrounding trees and sky. The constellations took shape and formed the faces of the friends he left behind in Alexandria. Shadows spread from the fire and Vivi watched the flames reach the top of the trees and then collapse to smoldering ash.</p>
<p>In the morning he pulled his gloves and boots tight, and entered the Dead Forest. The sun shone and at the shore of the Outer Continent he shielded his eyes from the midday sun, waving to the Alexandrian ship still waiting. He pushed his boat into the water, paddling through the waves, the scent of salt water filling his lungs. Though tears and an ocean of memories roiled within him, he closed his eyes and took of his hat, accepting the autumn sun on his face and head.</p>
