								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In  </em>Night in the Woods<em>, you play twenty-year-old Mae Borowski upon moving back to a hometown in decline. Her parents want to know why she just dropped out of college, her friends have all gotten jobs, her dreams keep getting weirder, and she believes there&#8217;s a mysterious threat lurking in the woods. </em>NITW<em> has won the BAFTA Game Award for Narrative and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival, among other accolades.</em></p>
<p><em>Scott Benson is the co-creator of  </em>Night in the Woods<em>. Below, Scott talks with </em>Cartridge<em> editor William Hoffacker about gothic horror, researching town histories, how Twitter helped him write dialogue, and more.</em></p>
<p><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b> begins with white text on a black background, with language and lineation evocative of poetry. Some lines are chosen by the player out of a few options, and some lines that follow reflect those choices. Although selecting words turns out to be a fundamental mechanic in the game, this prologue stands apart from the rest, as nothing else in the game looks quite like it.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>What is the intended purpose that necessitates this opening? What expectations is it meant to create? Why not just drop the player immediately into the first scene at the bus station?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mini interactive fiction bit at the start was sort of a statement of purpose, setting the tone of the game. We were about to put you right into the bus station with Mae, and things are colorful and funny and you’re learning to jump and run around for a while. But the game has other things on its mind, and we wanted to say up front, “Hey, this game has some preoccupations and context, let’s start thinking about that right from the jump.” The intro bit also gets across a lot of info in a very short amount of time, too. We wanted to give people a sense of where they were about to go, and who these people are, and what their context is. It feels out of place almost the first time you play the game, but I think eventually it fits right in as you get deeper into it, and especially if you do the recommended second playthrough. I’d say the game catches up to the info right around where Mae and Bea go the library and you start getting a lot of information about the town, and the themes of the game, which have been building through the first half, start emerging and interlocking in a way that matches up with that intro. That was the idea at least! Also it’s fun seeing Mae being all articulate and poetic, which she certainly is not for much of the game.</span></p>
<p><em><b>What sorts of literature do you most enjoy reading? What books (or other texts) had the most profound influence on the writing of  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two parts of the answer here—the literary influences and the research. Bethany did a whole lot of research for the history of Possum Springs. The game is based a lot on where she grew up, and she dove into old books detailing the ups and downs and struggles of towns like hers and Possum Springs. The history of labor struggle and exploitation, the out and out wars fought against bosses and police by workers, and the atrocities committed on entire towns by capital and the state, is often … well, suppressed maybe? We don’t learn a lot about it. But it’s there, and it’s not that long ago, and we still deal with these conditions today. Bethany is now practically an amateur historian of this kind of thing, and a lot of the details of the town’s past are pulled very much from real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as my end of things goes, I tend to read a lot of short story collections. I’ve been a pretty voracious reader all my life and I’m not sure why I have such a hard time getting through longer texts these days. Probably the untreated ADHD thing or something. So I take in a lot of shorter works, mostly horror or something lurid, folklore, and some general gothic lit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flannery O’Connor is an ever-present influence in the brand of gothic the game trades in. Her ability to explore the horrors lurking in southern Americana while suffusing the entire thing in this overarching, terrifying presence of grace, is an inspiration. I was a Christian for much of my life, was even in ministry, but lost my faith completely. But I connect with O’Connor’s “Christ-haunted” world. God is utterly gone for me, but the moments of grace remain in a beautiful naturally-occurring way, and exploring faith as a purely human phenomenon without anyone on the other end of the phone, so to speak, is interesting to me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Good Man Is Hard To Find</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wise Blood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were definite indirect influences in that arena, though O’Connor and I would disagree on the ultimate truth of God’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some weird fiction and cosmic horror makes it into the game as well, and it’s tough to get out from under the shadow of Lovecraft there. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Beyond</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a pretty direct influence on one pivotal scene. And we of course had our own plans for Lovecraft’s reactionary, racist, nationalist bullshit that pop up later on in the game. We do kind of a humanist, leftist cosmic horror, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d also shout out a little known weird fiction story called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dead Valley</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ralph Adams Cram. It’s one of the best “something weird is going on out there in the woods” stories ever.</span></p>
<p><b>Night in the Woods </b><em><b>frequently gives the player the opportunity to choose what the player-character, Mae, will say next. Such choices feel consequential, yet Mae is not some blank slate of a protagonist. She is an individual with a distinct, recognizable personality.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>So how did you strike that balance? What did you do to ensure that Mae would seem consistently herself while still giving the player a real sense of agency in directing her conversations?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t interested in empowering the player to roleplay. Alec and I decided from the start that this was Mae’s story, and she was her own person, and not a shell for the player. I really love exploration in games, and I think it’s maybe one of the best things you can do in a game both as a player and a designer. So navigating Mae’s life and navigating the dialogue is a type of exploration, just as running and jumping around the world is exploration. We were big on branching dialogue that felt organic and went on tangents, and were very anti Big Moral Choice moments. If anything we wanted to undercut any sense of the player being able to game her dialogue or character. This isn’t a game about making the Mae you want. It’s about exploring the Mae that is, and the world she lives in.</span></p>
<p><em><b>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any type, any scale), what work would you choose, and what might that game look and play like?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d love to see a good atmospheric horror post-point-and-click adventure game based on the Silver John stories by Manly Wade Wellman. Appalachian weird fiction. It’s dynamite and criminally unknown. The combo of easygoing wandering occult expert John The Balladeer and the devils lurking in various hollers is just so pleasing. Maybe just pick a handful of stories from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Fears The Devil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and run with it? And do it right. Actually wait don’t do this, I want to someday. I got dibs.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2649" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg 1920w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p><em><b>I assume that while you were writing dialogue for  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>, you knew that the game wouldn’t have voice acting, and instead the text would appear inside speech bubbles above the characters’ heads. Though the speech bubbles vary in size and shape, they never occupy a whole lot of real estate on screen.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>How much of a challenge was it to write all dialogue knowing it would be read within those confines? How did spatial limitations alter the content and/or the process of your writing?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on Alec and I knew we didn’t want to just do like a dialogue box at the bottom of the screen or something, and I sketched up some ideas of these fun little word bubbles and Alec implemented all of these expressive systems for making them wobble and boil, and animating the text and so forth. Writing for them became second nature very quickly, in part because I basically wrote everything in tweet length. I do a lot of twittering and it’s a platform that is underrated as far as style goes. You sort of learn how to segment longer thoughts, add pauses and single word tweets for humor and tension, all that kind of stuff. Twitter culture itself wasn’t a big influence on the dialogue, but the way Twitter trains you to work within strict character limits definitely was. So in the game we just learned to use that to our advantage. Also there’s nothing worse that opening up a conversation in-game and it’s just like paragraphs of unbroken text on screen. Chopping it up into smaller bits let us play with rhythm and pauses and personality and so forth. Also I think it feels better to click through a strategically segmented and timed series of bits than get hit with one big slab of dialogue.</span></p>
<p><em><b>If someone played  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b> and loved the experience so much that they just wanted more, more, more, what would you recommend they do next? (Recommendations might include other video games, but please feel free to answer however you like: books, movies, music, any activity, etc.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>. It’s a very clear influence on NITW. Seriously, drop what you’re doing and go play it. We owe a lot to that game. Similarly, <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em> has some DNA we swiped for our game. God, that game is a rare gem.</span></p>
<p><em><b>As large as religion looms over  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>, it wasn’t until my second playthrough that I noticed sun-shapes where I’d expect to see crosses. I realized that Christianity apparently doesn’t exist in this world because none of our cultural touchstones do. The characters speak of holidays different from ours. Saints and myths are recalled, but none we would recognize from history. Wars are invoked, but never by name. Even the constellations are invented. Also, the movies at the video store are made up (though  </b></em><b>The Shape of Water </b><em><b>seems derivative of  </b></em><b>Swamp Husband</b><em><b>), and I can’t recall any allusions to real-world celebrities (unless the Chris Evans run over by Mallard is </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>that</b></span><b> Chris Evans).</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>Why was it important to you that the game’s world be cut from whole cloth? How was your experience of originating so much at the cost of relying on established reference points—difficult, fun, both, something else?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>(Side-note: Writing this question brought to mind another game with anthropomorphic animals:  </b></em><b>Star Fox 64</b><em><b>. If the player shoots teammate Falco, he may respond, “Hey Einstein, I’m on your side,” which begs the question of why he uses the name Einstein in the same pejorative way that we do. One might ask, “Is their universe actually ours in the distant future? Do they have their own brilliant Einstein by coincidence?” Did you design  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><b> </b><em><b>to try to circumvent this sort of line of questioning?)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a pretty strict No Memes/No Reference Humor policy but we played the relationship to real world culture pretty loose. There are a very small handful of visual references and we mention like Shakespeare and a few other things from IRL culture here and there, but otherwise we wanted the world to exist on its own without propping ourselves up on some HEY REMEMBER THIS stuff. Like it’s fine to acknowledge or shout something out but we’ve had decades now of humor and culture that leans heavily on reference, and videogames are just rife with it. I think the Lovecraft material is the most blatant cultural riff in the game but that was because messing with cosmic horror stuff and his legacy in particular was a small part of what we were doing in the background. It was important for us to do as much as we could to create things that could stand on their own without having to fall back on reminding the player that they like <em>Star Wars</em> or whatever. A really clumsy overt reference in a work of fiction can throw me right out of it. And it’s just more fun and more interesting to create cultural touchstones that originate from and exist within the world you’re creating. It’s just a more satisfying way of doing things, and it feels more honest for lack of better words. That’s very much a your-mileage-may-vary thing but that’s where we came down on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as far as the religious symbology you mentioned, the church symbol in particular is part of a larger visual theme all over the place in the game, in a way a standard crucifix could never be.</span></p>
<p><em><b>What new games are you most anticipating right now? (Answers might include not only upcoming releases but also games already out that you haven’t gotten to play yet.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m really looking forward to the final episode of <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> which I believe drops this year. I played <em>The Witcher 3</em> for the first time earlier this year and was blown away by it, so I’m looking forward to the studio’s next game <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Whenever that comes out. <em>Ooblets</em> is looking really cool, and <em>Wandersong</em> seems like it’s gonna be some cheerful fun. Uh … <em>Dead Static Drive</em> looks super rad, as does <em>Knights And Bikes</em>. I’m probably forgetting something. Oh right I think there’s a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel out there somewhere. I’m a pretty big Souls games fan and I think the overall series could use a bit of a break but I’d definitely show up for a decent <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tacoma<em> is the latest game from Fullbright, the independent studio that first released  </em>Gone Home<em>. Both games feature a first-person p.o.v. player-character who explores an otherwise uninhabited environment, discovering a rich story by examining artifacts left by people who were once there. In  </em>Tacoma<em>, that setting is an abandoned lunar transfer station (the titular Tacoma), and the player attempts to learn the fate of its absent crew by accessing AR recordings of their lives. Enter a new part of the station and a new scene appears in the form of walking, talking figures, which the player can then play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward. Sometimes you follow characters from one room to another as they converse; you might hear how one crew member talks about another behind her back, then differently to her face. The experience creates a whole new sense of what it means to call a game&#8217;s story &#8220;immersive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Steve Gaynor is one of the founders of Fullbright. Below, he talks with  </em>Cartridge <em>editor William Hoffacker about  </em>Tacoma<em>&#8216;s development, his literary influences, and many games he recommends or looks forward to.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What were the greatest challenges of writing the story for  </em>Tacoma<em>?</em></strong></p>
<p>A lot of it was figuring out how to write a story in this way. The ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through <em>Tacoma</em>’s story meant that we had to think about writing the core scenes totally differently from how we had in any other game we’d worked on, or any other game we’d played, really. But once we had a working prototype of the AR scene playback mechanics, and a layout for the spaces the scenes took place in, we could start building out all the narrative threads within each scene as we supported what was happening at each point in the story—and from there the process was pretty natural, just a lot of work, hah.</p>
<p><strong><em>It seems to me that the first and foremost way that  </em>Tacoma<em>’s story could fail is if the player did not care what happened to the crew. What did you do (for example, via the dialogue, or visual cues, or any aspect of the game’s early moments) to try to ensure that your audience would immediately feel some attachment to the characters and thus want to discover their fate?</em></strong></p>
<p>The most important thing to us was to use the mechanics to allow the player to compare and contrast each character’s public vs. private self. The voyeurism of the AR scenes allows us to observe how the characters act when speaking to each other in a group, versus when speaking to each other in isolation, or how they behave when entirely on their own. We went for this early, for instance seeing EV’s take-charge nature with the crew in the debris impact scene, vs. her plaintiveness when back on her own in the bunk, or Clive’s gregarious banter with other members of the crew versus his private insecurities he shares with Germ. We hoped that this would allow the player to build a more complete picture of each of the characters as a fully realized individual, and build an attachment to them as a group of people they felt real empathy for.</p>
<p><strong><em>The station’s AI, ODIN, is visually represented by a large, humanoid eye inside a floating, upside-down pyramid. This imagery seems meant to evoke symbols associated with God, government, Illuminati tales—all likely to make one feel uneasy. What did you have in mind when you designed ODIN to look this way? What kind of player-reaction did you intend this model to evoke?</em></strong></p>
<p>ODIN, like many classic sci-fi AIs, is a presence whose true nature and motives are opaque to the player, especially at the start. The unknowability of AI is what makes them so fascinating. ODIN functions as a helper and coordinator on Tacoma, but he’s also always listening and watching—he’s directly tied to the digital surveillance that’s captured the 3D recordings you’re interacting with. So we wanted him to be an unblinking eye, and we wanted him to be a simple shape, an abstracted presence that could appear anywhere and interact with the crew. So that led us to the pyramidal all-seeing eye shape, flipped on its point to spin like a top. We also liked that, if you think of the iconic view of ODIN as being one side of the pyramid, ODIN is cycloptic, having one eye like the Norse god Odin, his namesake.</p>
<p><strong><em>Can you please describe the research that you did in order to develop  </em>Tacoma<em>? What kinds of texts did you read, and what types of people did you speak to?</em></strong></p>
<p>We did research on a few different vectors. We researched accounts of living in orbit on the ISS, and of living in extremely remote facilities such as research bases in Antarctica, to understand the dynamics and details of people confined to these kinds of places for long periods of time. We read books such as <em>An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth</em> by the astronaut Chris Hadfield, and various blogs and accounts by other astronauts and researchers. We also went back to a number of AI-themed science fiction novels and films, such as <em>2001</em>, <em>Moon</em>, <em>Alien</em>, and even classic texts like Asimov’s <em>I, Robot</em> for inspiration and reference points. As far as talking to individuals, probably the most direct interview research we did was with people in our circles who grew up in the Muslim faith. We wanted to get our depiction of Sareh right, so we talked to folks we knew when conceiving her character, and then had them play through a build of the game once her scenes were built and her bunk set up to see if we’d missed anything. Luckily it seems that with their help we were able to represent Sareh in an authentic way!</p>

<p><strong><em>What sorts of literature do you most enjoy reading? What books (or other texts) do you think had the most influence on the writing of  </em>Tacoma<em> and/or  </em>Gone Home<em>?</em></strong></p>
<p>I guess I have a fair breadth in what I read, though I have to admit I don’t read a whole lot compared to some people. I’m just a slow reader and easily distracted; it’s my own fault. But I guess I read a fair amount of modern lit (David Foster Wallace, Cormac McCarthy, Alice Munro…) and some classic sci-fi and crime fiction (Philip K. Dick, Jim Thompson) as well as some comics and graphic novels (Chris Ware, Adrian Tomine, I enjoyed <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters</em> by Emil Ferris last year, and am re-reading some of my old <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> books now…). I think that Alice Munro’s work as an author, and the TV show <em>My So-Called Life</em> were probably two of the most direct influences on <em>Gone Home</em>. <em>Tacoma</em> was probably more influenced by film and television: we drew from the crew of the Nostromo in <em>Alien</em>, and the vibe of Gerty from <em>Moon</em>, and the dynamic of McNulty’s unit from <em>The Wire</em> for how I thought about this group of misfits being thrown together and having to learn from each other and work within a system that’s bigger than any of them can comprehend. We were also deeply influenced by the immersive theater production <em>Sleep No More</em>, which is itself an adaptation/melding of Shakespeare’s <em>MacBeth</em> and Alfred Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>If someone played  </em>Tacoma<em> and/or  </em>Gone Home<em> and loved the experience so much that they just wanted more, more, more, what would you recommend they try next? (Such recommendations might include other video games to play, but please feel free to answer however you like: books, movies, music, even a long walk, etc.)</em></strong></p>
<p>As far as games go, I could recommend playing through <em>Minerva’s Den</em>, the downloadable story content for <em>BioShock 2</em> that Karla Zimonja, my story partner and studio co-founder, and I led together before we went indie to make <em>Gone Home</em>. It’s equal parts tragic romance and AI tale, and kind of forms a trilogy with <em>Gone Home</em> and <em>Tacoma</em>. I’d also suggest some other games in the first-person story subgenre, like <em>The Beginner’s Guide</em> by Davey Wreden or <em>Firewatch</em> by Campo Santo. There’s a free game I really love called <em><a href="https://turnfollow.itch.io/packingup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Packing Up the Rest of Your Stuff on the Last Day at Your Old Apartment</a></em>, which is about just what it sounds like, and is a simple and beautifully-crafted melancholic little game that’s well worth playing. I also loved this year’s <em>Butterfly Soup</em>, a visual novel-style game about a group of queer Asian teenagers who all love baseball. It’s incredibly funny, personal, and touching. I’d also suggest <em>Building Stories</em> by Chris Ware, a book collection that follows the story threads of one small apartment building in Chicago, and the people who live and die there. It’s incredibly inventive, beautiful, and heartbreaking, like so much of Ware’s work, and speaks to the personal and environmental style of storytelling that we focus on.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any type, any scale), what work would you choose, and what might that game look and play like?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think I’d adapt <em>Runaway</em> or <em>The Lives of Girls and Women</em> by Alice Munro. The sense of place and time and personal experience and the beauty with which Munro gives the reader a view into her characters’ lived experience is so vivid and so small that it feels just incredibly human. I’m not sure what the game would look or play like, but I just imagine how inhabiting those spaces and living through those moments could be really incredible.</p>
<p><strong><em>What new games are you most anticipating right now? (Answers might include not only upcoming releases but also games already out that you haven’t gotten to play yet.)</em></strong></p>
<p>Right now I hardly even have my eyes on the horizon as far as upcoming releases go. I’m still working on my backlog just from 2017. I played a ton of amazing stuff this year, but there are indie titles I still need to get to (<em>Detention</em>, <em>Everything Is Going to Be OK</em>, <em>Opus Magnum</em>, <em>Heat Signature</em>, <em>Mortician’s Tale</em>) and some AAA games I haven’t spent enough time with either (not far into the new Mario, though I did manage to finish the main quest in Zelda…). Conceptually, I loved <em>Resident Evil 7</em> a lot and I can’t wait to see where they go next after the huge shift that game was from prior entries in the series. <em>Far Cry 5</em> seems like it’s going into some intense territory with the new title and I’m really interested to see how that turns out. I’m incredibly intrigued to see what they do with <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>. Above all, I’m excited to see what new and unexpected indie and AAA games come out of nowhere to surprise us and give us experiences we’d never anticipated.</p>
