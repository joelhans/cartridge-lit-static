      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2017-07-07T10:31:16-05:00">July 7, 2017</time><p>For a long time I leave candles in the woods,<br>
hack at living roots, wait all night for a witch<br>
to cast a spell on my house.<br>
I want yards full of dinosaurs and giant<br>
cabbages, I want the woodpeckers<br>
to strike gold when they lay into a maple tree.</p>
<p>Here, rabbitsâ&#128;&#153; coats change color in winter,<br>
berry bushes morph to agave, an old mariner appears only<br>
when it rains â&#128;&#147; unbreathing â&#128;&#147; to tell me<br>
what Iâ&#128;&#153;m not ready for.<br>
I cross the bridge that divides the beach,<br>
find the boy who likes me enough to let me<br>
squeeze beneath his umbrella, the girl who<br>
plays her flute in the drizzle, in the graveyard, the girl who loves<br>
the stars and electrocutes me<br>
on accident, who marries me<br>
three days after I ask her, who brings her bedroom<br>
to my house, goes spelunking and builds bombs and mends<br>
fences sometimes. Â Years pass.<br>
What changes is</p>
<p>the strength of my pickax, the bows in my hair,<br>
the caverns that go down into the desert forever.<br>
It occurs to me, as I fill my bedroom<br>
with candles, my house does not</p>
<p>burn down, and I<br>
have never died.<br>
I have collapsed</p>
<p>in a garden, bled<br>
at the hands of skeletons, jumped<br>
into a hole I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t see<br>
the bottom of, have come bleatingly back<br>
in the doctorâ&#128;&#153;s office, the tears in my backpack<br>
leaking gems. Â I have stood atop dynamite, carried</p>
<p>strawberries large as my head, fed a statue,<br>
fished in sewers, but I have never felt the sun.<br>
I have had the strength of a mouse, a mountain,<br>
a flea. Â I have wanted badly</p>
<p>to dig up what I am sure is a boat on the beach but<br>
cannot. Â I have wanted to wait<br>
in the witchâ&#128;&#153;s house until she returns â&#128;&#147; or even slip off<br>
my shoes and swim â&#128;&#147; I never learned<br>
to swim. Â I have married<br>
the shopkeeperâ&#128;&#153;s daughter because of her moxie<br>
and purple hair, even though I wanted to marry<br>
the fisherman, the wizard, the goblin guarding<br>
the shack in the swamp. Â I have wanted</p>
<p>to savor pufferfish and tree-sap until<br>
the whites of my eyes turned black. Â To spike the punch, lock out<br>
the cows, wait for the wolves to come.<br>
To sleep an entire year.</p>
<p>Letâ&#128;&#153;s say<br>
I do, say I let<br>
the gardens wither, erase the memory<br>
of my wife, never milk the goats, fill the forest<br>
with bombs. Â These are the things<br>
I think about but donâ&#128;&#153;t do. Â Instead,<br>
I befriend the dwarf so heâ&#128;&#153;ll tell me<br>
his secrets, Â collect peaches, recycle the busted glasses<br>
I fished up from the sea.<br>
I have wanted to find</p>
<p>each fossil, each cracked<br>
vase and elfâ&#128;&#153;s crown â&#128;&#147; to collect and fill up<br>
those blank spaces that encase<br>
my mind. Â I<br>
have watched the cows<br>
give birth but never grow old,<br>
waited to see what<br>
my daughter would look like<br>
when (and would she?) leave the crib.<br>
I am scared</p>
<p>about what having a daughter means, how much<br>
like me sheâ&#128;&#153;ll be. Â Will I get to teach her to fish? Â Give her<br>
her sword? Â Lead her through caverns I have yet<br>
to break a bone in? Â She will be disappointed</p>
<p>to find every door already unlocked,<br>
every barrier cleared. Â She<br>
already automated, me standing<br>
solid in her path. Â How many seconds<br>
until she walks through me?<br>
I watch her plant a parsnip seed.<br>
Dread the day<br>
I turn her into doves.</p>
