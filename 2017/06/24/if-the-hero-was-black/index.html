13. He would get shot<br>
14. The dancing scarecrow would be his uncle<br>
15. He wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t agree with Ganondorfâ&#128;&#153;s looting<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">15.</span> but understand his feelings<br>
16. It would be him in the cell and<br><span style="color: #ffffff;">16.</span> Tingle the con artist outside<br>

20. There would be no way all that hair would fit under that cap<br>

<hr><p><b>For all the masks formed:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of race </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is a history of masks, a history</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those forced to </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">wear them, and those who do it</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">voluntarily. A mask is</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">a body: from the curls sewn</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">at its roots </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the thick of its bottom lip, </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link fits into all the masks:</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zora, </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goron, </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deku </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrub,</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">white boy</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">with blonde hair and blue eyes</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">fits all sizes, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone died for him </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">to wear that body,</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone lost for him </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">to wear those long </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">ivy green deku scrub locs,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it makes me wonder </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">what dead black girl Kylie Jenner</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is wearing,</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">who was sacrificed for </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">the pleasure </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Rachel Dolezal?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iâ&#128;&#153;ve watched people try on bodies so long</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mistook skin as clothing, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to be like Link,</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">wondering</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">who would have to die</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">for me to reincarnate into </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">another shade</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">or </span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">if I could only look beautiful</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">on another personâ&#128;&#153;s</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">face.</span></p>
<hr><p><b>Ganondorf</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">is going from being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawn in history</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a green pig into</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a dark skinned human,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but forever being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the main villain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is your rage being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the main plot but not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">what brought about</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the rage</span></p>
