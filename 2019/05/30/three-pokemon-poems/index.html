      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2019-05-30T10:39:06-05:00">May 30, 2019</time><p><strong>Self Portrait As A PokÃ©mon Yellow Playthrough</strong><br>  <br> Professor Oak asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl. <br> You shrug & check your<br> squirming pants. Yellow<br> ears pop out. Today,<br> gender is electric. <br> Stormy, even. Filled with<br> power. <br>  <br> Your rival asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.<br> You say, water gun. <br> You say, vine whip.<br> You say that you are<br> ember, slowly pulsing<br> across health bar like<br> alarms scrambling for potions. <br> Today, gender hasn’t<br> evolved yet. It’s growing<br> like a bulb, like a candle<br> inside a dragon’s cave.<br> Your rival stomps away,<br> says <em>smell ya later</em>. But <br> does gender smell? You <br> sniff your balls, all six<br> metallic red & white<br> as scentless as the <br> PokÃ©mon Center. <br>  <br> Misty asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl<br> & you say just give me <br> the bloody badge.<br> Brock asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl. <br> Actually he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t;<br> you Nurse no Joy.  <br>  <br> Team Rocket asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.<br> You unzip your fly & out <br> floats a ring of Clefairy. Tonight,<br> gender is metronome, is spinning<br> star, is blasting the villains off<br> into space. Into their own business.<br>  <br> Mewtwo asks you <br> if you are a boy or a girl<br> & you say that you have trapped<br> legends in pills, swallowed myths<br> like candy, like tongue is wild<br> grass where monsters live.<br> You say that the gender of one’s<br> birth is irrelevant. Gender isn’t the<br> gift of life, but the wrapping paper<br> & the bow. It’s the box inside the<br> PC, pixel deposits incubating in<br> cyberspace. <br>                     You ask Mewtwo<br> if they are a boy or a girl &<br> they say                         “No.” </p>

Gengar</strong></p>



<p>“Should you feel yourself
attacked by a sudden chill, it is evidence of an approaching Gengar. There is
no escaping it. Give up.” â&#128;&#147; PokÃ©mon Moon</p>



<p>During the seventh lunar month, you must never turn your head back when the shadows call your name. They want to steal it. They want what comes with your name. Keep walking straight. Even if fog tickles your breath. Even if fingers brush against shoulders.</p>



<p>Yet in the day, they call you by a different name. The name drags its hair across gravel. The name chatters & contorts. The name wears a thin white dress. The name drips across your spine like wax. The name tugs at your clothes with coffin-stained nails. Begs you to look it in the eye. It does not want offerings of incense or burnt Hell notes. Instead it is a <em>getai</em> song, constantly screaming in your head. Instead, they call you by a name you wish to forget, a corpse you haunt. They spin syllables that slither around your soul. When you turn around to answer, you feel the joss-sticks die. Your soul, a mote of ash in the wind. You answer the name that is not yours & forget how to live. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"><p><strong>778.
Mimikyu</strong></p>



<p>“After going to all the effort of disguising itself, its neck was broken. Whatever is inside is probably unharmed, but it’s still feeling sad.” â&#128;&#147; PokÃ©mon Sun</p>



<p>You are still trying to name
yourself, still scribbling on your tombstones, still threading through sutures.
You are partition & parenthesis. You are still trying to remember your
myths, untangling knots of flesh & fate. You are folklore & family curse.
You self-exorcist.</p>



<p>When a man touches you, does he see a twinkling pixie, or a meat mannequin? What colour does he see in your irises? Whose voice does he hear? Which cheekbone catches the light? Will his impish smile lead to nowhere? Will his fascination fade at sunrise, like every other boy before him? Or will he want to store you in a jar? When the crypt of your neck cracks, will he flee from the mogwais within? What does he want from you? Your ghost-parts, your fairy-parts, or the parts that are neither?</p>



<p>The mirror stares back every day. You donâ&#128;&#153;t know what shade youâ&#128;&#153;re looking at. You don’t know how skin feels like. Only silk. Only chiffon. You don’t know how a man’s tongue tastes like. Does it lick like lace? You pull at the seams of your parts. You donâ&#128;&#153;t know which part needs a cross-stitch. Maybe you need a lock of hair. Maybe you need the spell of someone else’s fingers. Maybe youâ&#128;&#153;re fine with not knowing. </p>
