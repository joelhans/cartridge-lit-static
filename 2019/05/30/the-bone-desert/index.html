      <h1 class="entry-title">The Bone Desert</h1>

            <h2 class="entry-author entry-author-large">Emrys Donaldson</h2>
      
      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2019-05-30T10:38:45-05:00">May 30, 2019</time><p>At dusk they moved through a landscape littered
with megafauna skeletons. Sand polished the bones and sifted into every crevice
on their bodiesâ&#128;&#148;between eyebrow hairs, into ear whorls, within clothing
creases. Huge jaws half-sunk in sand snapped at random, mandibles interlaced on
the squeak of something living, though neither of them saw anything move over
the tall dunes except tarantula-sized crickets which fell into holes at their
approach. Clumps of grass and scrubby bushes waited for the rains to bloom.</p>



<p>When they left the oasis that morning, others
walked alongside them, canteens sloshing against their legs, clear voices
singing harmonies. As the hours passed, the footprints faded. Most travelers
circumnavigated the dunes. He argued that traveling the mountain pass would add
weeks to their journey, and he wanted to cross the river to the valley town
before the river swelled with spring rain. With reluctance, they agreed. After
all, they told themself, getting a choice spot at the craft market would increase
sales of the hand-spun yarn and whittled dolls they carried. When he knew he
was going to get his way, he leaned in, held their arm, told them that in the
desert’s largest ribcage he would transform the cave jewel into the most
powerful sword in the realm. They wanted to believe him, but they were used to
the glass castles of his stories. </p>



<p>They pressed onward, toward the highest dune.
Wind formed ripples on the ridges which they destroyed with every step. When
they miscalculated trajectories of least resistance, the west-fading sand
scalded their palms. Tiny black beetles, barely larger than the sand
themselves, flailed in the avalanches created when they rested. They imagined
themself like the beetles trying to skate through the unforeseen. He kept turning
back to look at them. They tried to breathe against convulsing lungs, gave the
thumbs-up sign, and drank some water, hoping that if they pretended everything
was okay, it would be. Sand stuck in the dry cracks at the corners of their
lips. </p>



<p>They climbed the flanks of the Star Dune and
stood at its peak. On high, they noted landmarks on the map. The horizon hinted
at the valley. Below them, vertebrae the size of tires rested in a line. Dark
shapes floated across the sky, mirrored over the earth. In the distance,
thunder rumbled, and the breeze turned violent. They belly-crawled to avoid
lightning. When the gap between rumbles and flashes quickened, they curled up
on their packs. </p>



<p>Together they sheltered in the ribcage, the one
they meant to find, each rib big around as a cathedral column and casting
unearthly shadows. They sat with their backs against the largest rib and
covered their heads with fabric until the sand died down. He grinned and took
the prismatic shard from his pack. They loved his grin. Holding it, he walked
into the center of the ribcage, where it shape-shifted into an enormous purple
sword. In his excitement, he swung it, spinning and feinting, deep in battle
with an imaginary foe. They hugged their chin to their knees and watched. </p>



<p>As he spun, he mistimed and smashed the sword
into a rib. It stuck. They took turns pushing and pulling with combined weight.
No luck. Long after night fell, they hung their tentcloth from the blade, tying
the cloth edges to the other ribs. In sleep, they faced each other, their
foreheads, knees, and feet touching, packs under their heads. Sandy breeze
weighed down the cloth they wrapped around themselves. </p>



<p>All night they dreamed of escape from the belly of a cyclopean beast. He was there, too, his impish eyes above the edge of his scarf, mashing his feet into the muck as though stomping grapes. Their feet stuck in a churning mass of half-masticated flesh and meteoric stoats. Acidic moisture condensed on the walls of skin. When they tried to climb out, they gained purchase only to slip and crash. In dreamtime they melted into skeletons still trapped.</p>



<p>When the two of them woke, it was to vulture screeches and the sound of tiny bones clinking through a grate. In the night the towers migrated. Gathering dew from the tentcloth, they poured it into a bottle. In the light, the sword looked smaller than before. Onward they trekked, toward the town on the other side of the desert. They made a pact to not look back at the sword. On the next rise, he broke it. </p>
