      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2019-05-30T10:37:05-05:00">May 30, 2019</time><p><strong><em>(B)</em></strong>             has always taught me to run<br> whether it be from a pokemon battle or an<br> unexpected visit from an actual beeâ&#128;&#153;s noise.<br> i <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run up stairs</p>



<p> like i’m sure to see my father. & i am not his,<br> just mine, & my thick hair twists, once in, now,<br> just now, an unrivalled out.         i barely<br> care about what he thinks about my hair,</p>



<p> the ones i love, the way i dress, the way i give love,<br>                   as i would barely,<br> remember my nintendo DS Lite. how it don’t<br> work no more â&#128;&#152;cause it had guillotined to<br> divorce right after the charger had broke.<br> i do remember<br>                   <em>Ranger, & Platinum, & Diamond,</em><br> riddled quiet in dusted cases; each<br> pokemon game & cartridge i<br> had as all i had<br>                                     when<br> my father wasn’t there.                 & when my son,<br><em>Mew</em>, reached level 100, i had made the best of<br> the hand      <em>Oak</em>      dealt me.                <em>Red, Ash,   &<br> Silver</em><br>                     all dreamt my dream for a father<br> & i remember how they all never spoke. & i<br> remember whichever name you gave him</p>



<p> becoming the boyâ&#128;&#153;s name. Silverâ&#128;&#153;s mom got<br> running shoes from Silverâ&#128;&#153;s dad.<br> Silver once bumped into a cave atop a mountain<br>                     & then found him – Red,<br>                     at its precipice,<br>                                     transforming into,<br>                     now, just now, a Mew </p>



<p>– with its hair returned untethered & to<br>      its original form; & so mindful<br> a Mew, in fact, he did learn how to learn<br> any move so one<br>                     might be performed like a dance which<br> might serve, like a mating call, to summon<br>                     a father who too                     searches for father.</p>



<p> remember? that conflict with Mew. once led<br> ashâ&#128;&#153;s heart to petrified stone in the stale air. &<br> how diamond should sublimate to stale air,<br> a Pikachuâ&#128;&#153;s tear once hauled Ash from his<br> cryogenesis, in fact, so well – Ash hasn’t aged<br> since, which implies Ash could die & get born<br> again & still have no father. we all remember</p>



<p> waking up alone & to a new mother, saying<br>                     <em>not a thing<br>                                 has changed,      not our father,      not<br> our mountains,     not Pokemon.â&#128;&#157;</em><br>           as fathers go unmentioned in the games<br>           until 2002,         my dad & i still don’t talk.<br> i wonder about how much it has to do with</p>



<p> being a father.    i go to capture<br> a momentâ&#128;&#153;s truth & stick it in poems<br> as trainers <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run to catch the Mewtwo<br>                                                   with just pokeballs.<br> i hope Red had taken time to write his<br> requiem for his lost dad, when trainer<br> Silver, had happened<br> to find him praying at the mountain froth.</p>



<p> perhaps Red caught a cold & this<br> father-poem needed to be about how cold &<br> alone Red felt. maybe his throat<br> hurt too much to talk so Red fled the fight<br>                                    in hopes to get a healing with<br> his father. maybe it was less of a <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run &<br> moreso <strong><em>(A)</em></strong> jump; that his father was just<br> a sky away. just now.<br>                                     i <strong><em>(B)</em></strong> run up stairs like i will<br> see my own. in the sky. from the top step<br> of mountains until iâ&#128;&#153;m downstairs<br> with my single mother again.</p>
