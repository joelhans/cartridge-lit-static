      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2016-10-10T06:00:26-05:00">October 10, 2016</time><p>Here is the beanstalk in winter</p>
<p>Here every surface earns its ice</p>
<p>Here there is a reward for your slowness</p>
<p>Here you will dig turnips from the frozen ground<br>
and cast them into the ocean</p>
<p>Here the whales are platforms to cross<br>
not like the real whales you will (nine years from now)<br>
read as glossy spots of wet ink</p>
<p>Here you will stand on a whaleâ&#128;&#153;s spout<br>
and be lifted</p>
<p>Here you can fling a potion and a door will sprout up</p>
<p>Here you can go on in to where it is evening<br>
and discover that you love it there</p>
<p>Here you will find elegance and lower body strength<br>
as the princess</p>
<p>Here as she leaps she lifts her skirts</p>
<p>Here you can hear her taffeta sweep the ice<br>
your taffeta</p>
<p>Here you learn where you want a door to grow<br>
and where a door will not be useful</p>
<p>Here you are only nine<br>
so you can create instructions on how to finish this level<br>
for the Rabbi who is still a family friend</p>
<p>Here you can slide on the ice<br>
with your sister</p>
<p>Here when you are hurt your body is shortened<br>
legs chopped from beneath you</p>
<p>Here if you hold the a-button you can linger in the air<br>
a canyon-jumper</p>
<p>Here the dogs behind you in the living room are both alive<br>
one of them licking a bald spot in the brown rug</p>
<p>Here every entrance feels like a secret entrance</p>
<p>Here the clouds are solid</p>
<p>Here behind you is the record player<br>
the piano with its green glass lamp and stuffed full bench</p>
<p>Here in this house on Hope Avenue there is a basement<br>
always on the verge of flooding</p>
<p>Here in the basement there is a seizure room<br>
with blankets on the floor for one of the dogs</p>
<p>Here the ice shines like glass</p>
<p>Here the cacti have frozen and have lost their needles</p>
<p>Here you will unearth a rocket ship<br>
once you learn where to dig</p>
