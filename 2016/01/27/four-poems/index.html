<p>There is a little girl everywhere who cleans glasses behind a bar.<br>
I borrowed her to show you how I feel when I do something nice<br>
for someone to show them I love them. I borrow my womb from<br>
myself to be a nest for your thoughts. I want to exist as someoneâ&#128;&#153;s<br>
metaphor. I want to be tucked into a window when the world goes<br>
out, watching the lights of our souls burst and fade like carpet bombs.</p>
<hr><p><strong>AÂ Prehistory of Mermaid Wives</strong></p>
<p>your hair got so long in the time that I knew you that I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t find you Â  Â  Â I<br>
painted dolphins at sunset on bar slat walls Â  Â  Â when we lived in the<br>
mountains Â  Â  I dared you to swim in the creek Â  Â  Â show me that tail of yours<br>
splashing in shallows Â  Â  Â  Â you re<br>
fused, waited Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  later, older, under cigarette haze, youâ&#128;&#153;ll lend me your lips<br>
fade on me like always when you’re drunk you shut things off<br>
like pregnancy Â  Â  Â  like staph Â  bedroom lights Â  Â  your thighs</p>
<hr><p><strong>Zolom Memory</strong></p>
<p align="left">The night we ran across the swamp we were drinking lemonade<br>
on the porch.<br>
Eating red beet eggs. It was summer. The light was that goldenrod hue<br>
you only get one hour of</p>
<p align="left">each day seems like. This poem sounds like it’s going to be about<br>
destruction but is<br>
actually about snakeskin & your torn cuticles & how they scratch the<br>
sides of my cheeks when you’re</p>
<p align="left">holding my face in your hands, saying oh little bee what are we going<br>
to do about that, pulling<br>
your hands down to my heart and rubbing my sternum in awkward circles.<br>
That night the neighbor saw me</p>
<p align="left">hugging myself walking to the store, and asked if I was sick. I<br>
wish she could’ve<br>
seen the other me, the one in dotted lines and daydreams, perform the dance:</p>
<p align="left">Collapse in place Â  Â clutch at heart with hands Â  Â  watch ribs spread<br>
automatically Â  Â  watch snakes<br>
voles salamanders pour out Â  Â  Â laugh. They fled into slivers in the<br>
cattails, open doors, the dark places.</p>
<hr><p align="left"><strong>Holy</strong></p>
<p>Do not forget about evil, little one.<br>
Evil is a rainstorm.<br>
Then, because of the falling of the water<br>
we get flooded with it.<br>
Boil your incoherence, child,<br>
this is not your time.<br>
I know you will not listen to me.<br>
All of us are born fixers.</p>
