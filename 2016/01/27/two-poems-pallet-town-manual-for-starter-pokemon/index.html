<p>Consciousness does not always begin<br>
with waking, but a quiet disorientation<br>
of glinting metal, curtainless windows,<br>
books on the floor like upturned palms.</p>
<p>The street is set with houses basking<br>
in the company of cherry blossoms â&#128;&#147;<br>
not mean or rowdy, but calibrated<br>
pipettes of fuchsia and adoration.</p>
<p>It is the bed you have been resting in<br>
for years. Someone is making coffee<br>
and expecting you to rise. Your body<br>
measures the character of this silence</p>
<p>but there are languages outside<br>
of geometry. Your mouth is dry.<br>
It has started to rain and this town<br>
will not be how you remember it.</p>

<p><strong>Manual for Starter Pokemon</strong></p>
<p><em>I. Bulbasaur</em></p>
<p><span class="full">Of all ancient-footed soil-sifters</span><br><span class="half">you know these rituals best, first</span><br>
the crinkled promise of a seed,<br><span class="half">pact with the dark, then an embryo’s</span><br><span class="full">bloodless feast on damp and sun.</span><br><span class="half">When the shadow of your labours</span><br>
eclipses your own, fertile bulb<br><span class="half">cleaving open, you cannot ignore</span><br><span class="full">how the language of nature is</span><br><span class="half">an unnatural one: germination,</span><br>
photosynthesis, self-serving pollination.<br><span class="half">Nothing has changed. Your burden</span><br><span class="full">is no less because it has bloomed.</span></p>
<p><em>II. Charmander</em></p>
<p><span class="half">Never the flame, but restraint</span><br><span class="full">of its reptilian temper. Make peace</span><br><span class="half">where confrontation is poor excuse</span><br>
for glory. Winged or quick-clawed,<br><span class="half">the battles which matter are the ones</span><br><span class="full">bargained with yourself, pride of identity,</span><br><span class="half">unattainable flight. Yet what little room</span><br>
for compromise in this <em>Bildungsroman</em><br><span class="half">is down to luck. Incinerate your bets.</span><br><span class="full">Nothing comes from playing with fire.</span></p>
<p><em>III. Squirtle</em></p>
<p>Like all rivers, the one buried in you<br><span class="half">has neither head nor tail, but endless</span><br><span class="full">regard for past and future allegiances.</span><br><span class="half">Take heed of its density, how a friend</span><br>
resists or embraces water. Shell, carved from<br><span class="half">calloused skin and bruises, is not armour</span><br><span class="full">but to accept vulnerability. The same</span><br><span class="half">is true of friendship: next to each other</span><br>
but oceans apart.</p>
