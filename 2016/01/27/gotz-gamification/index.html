      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2016-01-27T06:00:50-06:00">January 27, 2016</time><p><strong>Gotz</strong></p>
<p>On the outskirts of town, in a timber house<br>
too large for one, I can find you on your own.<br>
Head down at the lathe or tablesaw, gaze fixed,</p>
<p>your hands rough and steady. You make tables,<br>
cut lumber, upgrade the town hall. All furnishings<br>
pass through your palms. The woods are in you.</p>
<p>Your crown of chestnut hair, your knotted fists,<br>
your thick trunk ringed with winters. I am thankful<br>
you came to my farm to chop the oak blocking</p>
<p>the forest path. I say so and touch you, grazing<br>
the bark of your elbow. But then, you are telling me<br>
of the blizzard, your words bursting like a storm,</p>
<p>blow through and bury so fast, leaving only snow<br>
silence. You rattle off sums: the measure of coffins,<br>
of time spent sanding wood that would hold a wife,</p>
<p>a child, and carry them to where you could not go.<br>
You dreamed of returning to the earth with your kin.<br>
And then, snow silence. You pursed your thin lips,</p>
<p>flexed your weary arms. A tree chopped down,<br>
its branches used for bar stools. Its white heart<br>
turned into a cross to mark a family grave.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr><p> </p>
<p><strong>Gamification</strong></p>
<p>When you will try anything,<br>
you can turn your body into a game.</p>
<p>Remember to feed it pills daily,<br>
star any chart on an app. Pee on sticks<br>
first thing each day. Aim carefully.<br>
Wait a fixed amount of time.<br>
You can play every game alone.</p>
<p>Months pass while you stick at it,<br>
then years. Others have moved on<br>
to the sequel, the next big thing.<br>
But you persist. You are so close.</p>
<p>You hope for a level-up, new content.<br>
You aim to defeat the boss. Save<br>
the princess. But the boss is you,<br>
and you are the princess too.</p>
<p>And no matter how many hours<br>
you put in, you start each day<br>
again at the beginning.<br>
You cannot make new life.</p>
