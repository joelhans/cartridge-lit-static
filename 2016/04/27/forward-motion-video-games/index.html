<p>There is a forward motion in old video games<br>
That keeps a character from going back.<br>
When you move, the camera pans from left<br>
To right but stops when you turn back.<br>
Some wall is following. The music keeps playing.</p>
<p>The same opponent appears over and over<br>
Trudging toward your fists. The surface is a knot<br>
That tightens on one end while it loosens<br>
On the other. The sky is full of ether.<br>
Tubes lead nowhere. The wall persists.</p>
<p>The world is divided into levels, so it stands<br>
To reason, life was worse in the beginning.<br>
As the dead pile up, the evil thins but in force<br>
Increases. The wall was built to keep it<br>
From circling back to the beginning.</p>
<p>The screen is very dusty, kid. Go back to work.<br>
One day the wall will be gone for good.<br>
Good and evil will act exactly the same,<br>
And all that we accomplished from dying and saving<br>
Will be erased as if weâ&#128;&#153;d never been playing.</p>
