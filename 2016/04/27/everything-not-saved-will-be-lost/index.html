</style><p>Bleary pixels rhapsodize a total absence of midnight. Of hearts lost & levels gained</p>
<p>as you drifted off to sleep watching a drawbridge snatched from beneath</p>
<p>Bowserâ&#128;&#153;s feet for the umpteenth time, & red rupees & bottled fairies scrounged</p>
<p>from blockbushes, or the next robotic mini-boss blown to bits by a mega buster</p>
<p>blast. You, baby brother, who only liked to watch but never play, for hours on</p>
<p>end as an 8-bit fanfare blipped deep into the school night. I promised not to tell</p>
<p>mom if you didnâ&#128;&#153;t & we were safe then from the dive-bombing, spinnaker sun</p>
<p>of lifeâ&#128;&#153;s grief; the unseen, falling thwomps of a future beyond our tiny</p>
<p>understanding. Little did we know some green mushrooms were poison to the</p>
<p>touch, how some things cannot be cured by a magical leaf or bouncing star:</p>
<p>your sadness among themâ&#128;&#148;that killer glitch inside that would cause you to click</p>
<p>game over forever, to leave me clutching controller #2 on infinite pause. Now I</p>
<p>canâ&#128;&#153;t stop playing the same level over & over, the one you swore bore a secret</p>
<p>pipe to rainbow road, & I cannot forgive myself for all the years I watched you</p>
<p>struggling to unshrink without pitching you a power-up: I watched but didnâ&#128;&#153;t</p>
<p>play until it was too late, the lava at your neck & all continues consumed. All I</p>
<p>know now is somewhere in the mushroom kingdom thereâ&#128;&#153;s a triangular flag</p>
<p>eternally at half-mast, an invisible question box whose vine shall never stretch to</p>
<p>that bonus stage in the sky. & I keep waiting at the end of your favorite level for</p>
<p>a fake princess to tell me the truth: the life you thought youâ&#128;&#153;d find is in another castle.</p>
