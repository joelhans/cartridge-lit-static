<p><strong>GLHF</strong></p>
<p>Good luck, have fun: A polite salutation at the</p>
<p>beginning of a game. The accepted response</p>
<p>is â&#128;&#156;u2â&#128;&#157; often with an emoticon signifying</p>
<p>happiness. // Your swords say hello. Itâ&#128;&#153;s nice to</p>
<p>meet you. You pull off your gauntlets and shake</p>
<p>hands. Someone rolls out a red carpet. It is the</p>
<p>tongue of a sea monster. It is the insides of ten-</p>
<p>thousand different soldiers.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>USE/INTERACT</strong></p>
<p>Because of the popular game company Valveâ&#128;&#153;s</p>
<p>default setting, this is traditionally bound to the</p>
<p>â&#128;&#156;eâ&#128;&#157; button on your keyboard. Pressing this key</p>
<p>will perform the most predictable action on any</p>
<p>of the virtual worldâ&#128;&#153;s entities. When you press</p>
<p>e while facing a sink, the faucet turns on, while</p>
<p>facing a treasure chest, it creaks open, while</p>
<p>facing a person, they speak to you. // You once</p>
<p>read that if a female and a male are facing</p>
<p>directly at each other, they are about to either</p>
<p>fight or fuck. Look, you are facing everything</p>
<p>around you.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>CLIPPING</strong></p>
<p>The process of game design concerned with</p>
<p>matching what the player sees (graphics and</p>
<p>textures) with what the player can touch,</p>
<p>move through, and stand on. It is, in effect, the</p>
<p>gameâ&#128;&#153;s entire physical world. Designers sculpt</p>
<p>a complex rendering out of a simple geometric</p>
<p>shape in order to match a picture of the desired</p>
<p>character or object. â&#128;&#156;Bad clippingâ&#128;&#157; results in</p>
<p>invisible walls and matter. Many games allow</p>
<p>the player to turn clipping off with a cheat</p>
<p>such as â&#128;&#156;noclip.â&#128;&#157; This allows the player to walk</p>
<p>through walls, floors, doors, trash-cans, fire</p>
<p>extinguishers, scientists, you name it. // There</p>
<p>is a only a slab. â&#128;&#156;I saw the angel in the marble</p>
<p>and I carved until I set him free.â&#128;&#157; And the angel</p>
<p>started many wars. Every world depended on</p>
<p>you. On the day the angel was slain, all the</p>
<p>cathedral ceilings crumbled. Our air rushed in.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>AFK</strong></p>
<p>Away from keyboard: A state of inactivity</p>
<p>usually caused by the player not being at the</p>
<p>computer or controller. Can be used figuratively</p>
<p>in the sense of â&#128;&#156;I do not want to play this game</p>
<p>anymore.â&#128;&#157; Players can actively â&#128;&#156;go afkâ&#128;&#157; by</p>
<p>remaining near their keyboard and refusing to</p>
<p>move their character. // You are staring at the</p>
<p>statue of a lion. When the light hits it, he may</p>
<p>take a step. You are staring at the statueâ&#128;&#153;s</p>
<p>eyelid. Open, please.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>IRL</strong></p>
<p>In real life: Used to distinguish between actions</p>
<p>of the player and character: â&#128;&#156;i need to go shop</p>
<p>irlâ&#128;&#157; and player relationships: â&#128;&#156;we know each</p>
<p>other irl.â&#128;&#157; // The time before putting on your</p>
<p>socks in the morning, and the floor shocks cold</p>
<p>into your heels. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve left the shower on for a</p>
<p>couple minutes to steam your shirt and tie. You</p>
<p>are standing in a cloud. After, shedding your</p>
<p>clothes, you slump to the ground.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>NPC</strong></p>
<p>Non-playable character(s): Those the player</p>
<p>may not control, but who interact with the player</p>
<p>and often advance the storyline, similar to minor</p>
<p>and supporting roles in a film // You go to the</p>
<p>store and talk to the mannequins. You drag</p>
<p>them through the aisles, through the checkout.</p>
<p>Sirens. Only they know how it ends.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>GRIEFING</strong></p>
<p>An attempt to ruin the game for other players.</p>
<p>The most common form is killing members of</p>
<p>your own team but can be things like stealing</p>
<p>items, playing the game incorrectly, barring</p>
<p>paths, and simply following someone against</p>
<p>their will. // There is no gas in the car and you</p>
<p>are late for work. All the lights are green, but the</p>
<p>driver in front of you stops to butcher a deer.</p>
<p>Now they are red, the whole world is red. Sir,</p>
<p>would you kindly come with us?</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>L2</strong></p>
<p>Learn to: Impolite suggestion that another</p>
<p>player should learn anything from basic skills</p>
<p>to game-centric skills. â&#128;&#156;l2pâ&#128;&#157; means â&#128;&#156;learn to</p>
<p>playâ&#128;&#157; Other more extreme endings can be</p>
<p>substituted: â&#128;&#156;l2uninstallâ&#128;&#157; or even â&#128;&#156;l2killyourself.â&#128;&#157;</p>
<p>// You always thought everything would fall. The</p>
<p>bike teeters, your foot scrapes the corner of the</p>
<p>balance beam. You are holding your first child.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>FTW</strong></p>
<p>For the win: A celebratory incantation of</p>
<p>praise that can be attached to players or game</p>
<p>circumstances. As an army of ghosts walk on</p>
<p>screen, a player may say â&#128;&#156;ghosts ftw,â&#128;&#157; but it</p>
<p>may also be used ironically. As an ally charges</p>
<p>to his death, players may say â&#128;&#156;leeroy jenkins</p>
<p>ftwâ&#128;&#157; // You are leaping over a puddle and</p>
<p>everyone on the other side is made of smiles.</p>
<p>When heels wet, they lock their hands on your</p>
<p>forearms whispering, â&#128;&#156;You could have died.â&#128;&#157;</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>WP</strong></p>
<p>Well played: Often coupled with gg as part</p>
<p>of the surrender or end-game ceremony. It</p>
<p>is considered good manners to say this with</p>
<p>your gg // The scene with the motorcycle gets</p>
<p>you the most. The T1000 is chasing him. You</p>
<p>remember what it felt like for your dad to let you</p>
<p>ride. But when the lava is melting through metal,</p>
<p>you know that they will both die. You bury your</p>
<p>face in the couch cushions because this is the</p>
<p>way it has to be.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1.2rem 1.2rem 0 1.2rem; width: 440px;">
<p><strong>GG</strong></p>
<p>Good game: The official white-flag of gaming.</p>
<p>When said by the losing player it means</p>
<p>â&#128;&#156;I surrender.â&#128;&#157; When said in response by</p>
<p>the winning player it means â&#128;&#156;I accept your</p>
<p>surrender.â&#128;&#157; When the player who is winning (or</p>
<p>thinks they are) says it before the other player,</p>
<p>it is then a taunt and is often considered bad</p>
<p>manners. // You exit the building waving white</p>
<p>blankets. They board your ship. They throw</p>
<p>your journal overboard. People run through the</p>
<p>streets shouting this. They carry flags. The flags</p>
<p>trail behind them, blood. Cheers rise up. The</p>
<p>whole city undulates between the gâ&#128;&#153;s.</p>
