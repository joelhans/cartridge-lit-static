      <h1 class="entry-title">When my dad & I played Tecmo Super Bowl</h1>

            <h2 class="entry-author entry-author-large">Justin Brouckaert</h2>
      
      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2014-07-14T08:00:42-05:00">July 14, 2014</time><p>I always chose the 49ers even though we were Lions</p>
<p>fans because the 49ers were my favorite NFL team</p>
<p>that actually had a shot. Every play I blitzed Ronnie</p>
<p>Lott up the middle & stuffed Barry at the line. Tecmo</p>
<p>Barry was pretty good, but he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t dance like the real</p>
<p>Barry, just like how I could run fly patterns for my dad</p>
<p>in our front yard but in a pick-up game even the easiest</p>
<p>passes bounced off my hands. Instead of football</p>
<p>I played soccer & instead of soccer I ran & instead</p>
<p>of running I broke both my knees with fractures so</p>
<p>tiny I felt like I was lying when I tried to explain. Detroit</p>
<p>hates Barry for leaving early but maybe he was just</p>
<p>trying to minimize the pain. Now I bet heâ&#128;&#153;s somewhere</p>
<p>wiggling his toes & drinking hard lemonade & weâ&#128;&#153;re</p>
<p>still freezing our asses off in this city saying <em>You canâ&#128;&#153;t</em></p>
<p>just quit to a man who doesnâ&#128;&#153;t even exist anymore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we werenâ&#128;&#153;t playing Tecmo we were sharing</p>
<p>the same life on Super Pitfall for the NES until</p>
<p>Playstation came & then we were racing head-to-head</p>
<p>on Test Drive 5. Then there was Gameday â&#128;&#153;98,</p>
<p>a game I loved like family but played alone for years</p>
<p>because my dad struggled with controls that werenâ&#128;&#153;t</p>
<p>just A/B plus D-pad & even though I had a different</p>
<p>quarterback this time around, our games always</p>
<p>ended with Jerry Rice streaking down the sidelines</p>
<p>& me running up the score. Like Barry, one day</p>
<p>I just gave it all up, stopped playing before my fingers</p>
<p>went like my knees. I mean, I donâ&#128;&#153;t fuck with it</p>
<p>anymore, unless Iâ&#128;&#153;m drunk with my friend & he wants</p>
<p>to play Madden & then for an hour I get to spin,</p>
<p>sprint & make hard cuts on the turf without my joints</p>
<p>snapping in protest. My dad & I find other things to do</p>
<p>together now, like watching football instead of trying</p>
<p>to be it, or charging his remote-control helicopter</p>
<p>& taking it for a spin down in the valley. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve lived</p>
<p>like this for years, except the last time I was home</p>
<p>he surprised me by firing up Gameday like it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t sixteen</p>
<p>years old & making Barry look like the nineties</p>
<p>all over again. I sat for a while & watched Gameday Barry</p>
<p>looking seven years older than Tecmo Barry, seven</p>
<p>years smarter than Tecmo Barry, shaking defenders like he</p>
<p>always used to do, like Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure he misses now, even</p>
<p>just a little, no matter where he is. My dad didnâ&#128;&#153;t ask</p>
<p>me to play & I didnâ&#128;&#153;t ask eitherâ&#128;&#148;even though itâ&#128;&#153;s</p>
<p>what I really wantedâ&#128;&#148;because I canâ&#128;&#153;t remember whether</p>
<p>the X-button is left or bottom-center anymore</p>
<p>& anyway my dad looked pretty locked in, thumbs jumping,</p>
<p>making moves I had forgotten a long time ago.</p>
