[Atari 2600 Video Game Adaptation]</strong></p>
<p>There is no Flash Gordon, only this space<br>
ship swiveling back and forth in an arena<br>
of stars that are not stars but pixels flickering,<br>
an illusion of movement. There is no enemy<br>
swarm that strikes with violent shimmer,<br>
only the soul which is really that confusion<br>
a boy feels when he tries to pay attention<br>
to three things at once. Above: an expedition<br>
to rescue astronauts, who are not men<br>
but lights outlining a manâ&#128;&#153;s body<br>
as a boy imagines it to beâ&#128;&#148;blocky,<br>
upright, arms windmilling to maintain<br>
balance in the abyss. Below: the map,<br>
contorted and tangled, no wind rose,<br>
no landmark. Outside: your father<br>
who is your father but also a wraith,<br>
your father who is not your father<br>
but a series of monstrous noises in the ether.<br>
There is a force field. There is a joystick.<br>
There is no Flash Gordon, only a boy<br>
and a video game that is not a video game<br>
but that is lion heart and lily liver,<br>
that is the future of the universe, that is<br>
whatâ&#128;&#153;s left inside a boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Self Portrait as Flash Gordon</strong><br><strong> [Commodore 64 Video Game Adaptation]</strong></p>
<p>1.<br>
Skeletons, you spear me through<br>
the chest, hollow spot where once<br>
a target pulsed. Ape-men, you descend<br>
from trees, rend limb from shoulder<br>
blade from ankle bone. The spiders<br>
know I am the electron, the lightning<br>
spirit, power up and pixel heart.<br>
The jungle slides by screen by screenâ&#128;&#148;<br>
yawning chasm, dinosaur breath.<br>
Bees, you swarm my body,<br>
as if agony could be electricity<br>
could be flesh. You cannot destroy<br>
what I do not have.</p>
<p>2.<br>
I am callouses on a manâ&#128;&#153;s knuckles,<br>
blockbuster and right cross. I am<br>
heartshine. I am thumb cramp. I am a fistful<br>
of sand, a dash of gravel to close<br>
a manâ&#128;&#153;s eyes. I am knife hand, praying<br>
mantis, crescent moon kick in a fight<br>
that moves too quick for blood, too dirty<br>
for choreography. I am groin punch.<br>
I am groin punch.<br>
I am groin punch.</p>
<p>3.<br>
There is no such thing as speed,<br>
only moving landscapes, a geography<br>
for empty space. There is no such thing<br>
as geography, only acceleration, a motorcycle<br>
chase in 16 colors across a checkerboard.<br>
I am wildfire and gasoline. I am desire<br>
fizzing in the bottle, sun bursting for yolk.<br>
The explosions know there are no explosions,<br>
only blasts of color against the pale blue,<br>
a voice at the vanishing point: Velocity is just<br><em>a trick of light, a man just a body in motion</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Self Portrait as Flash Gordon</strong><br><strong>[Bally Pinball Squawk & Talk Isolation]</strong></p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br>
This machine has a reputationâ&#128;&#148;all screech<br>
and catcall, lights and sound bites to spur<br>
you to nudge and bangback. Everything<br>
is drawn to the drain eventually.</p>
<p><em>Emperor Ming Awaits</em><br>
You canâ&#128;&#153;t choose your own enemies.<br>
Others will make that decision<br>
for you. Give up on karate chops<br>
and fancy kicks, on rooster feathers,<br>
on eagle claws. Shoot your steel<br>
ball into the fray, realize your desire<br>
for tattoosâ&#128;&#148;lightning bolt, rocketship<br>
vs. mystery planet, a womanâ&#128;&#153;s name.</p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br>
Not your name. A strobe of light.<br>
Your name. A lifespan.</p>
<p><em>Ignite Death Rays, Fifteen Seconds</em><br>
Your mother predicted you would grow<br>
up to be an astronaut, your father anything<br>
but an astronaut. The lights strobe quick<br>
like the quasarâ&#128;&#153;s flicker, the eyeball shimmer.<br>
This machine speaks with the android fuzz,<br>
the buzz and crackle insisting you<br>
give up on moonwalks, on swimming<br>
in asteroid fields. Give up on sexy space<br>
suits and ever flying with a jet pack.</p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br>
Over ramp and cockcrow. Through comet<br>
and sonic boom. In the thick of slingshot<br>
and kicker. Straight past your flippers.</p>
<p><em>Ignite Death Rays, Fifteen Seconds</em><br>
The ball spits out of the kickout hole,<br>
ricochets past bumper pop and target<br>
dropâ&#128;&#148;there are no death rays,<br>
only reprieve from true peril. Give up<br>
to invisible knuckles, to middle school<br>
hallways, to number two pencils<br>
gripped like shivs. On the backglass,<br>
Flash Gordon is dashing with a golden<br>
machete. Emperor Mingâ&#128;&#153;s bodyless head<br>
fixes you with a sinister glare.</p>
<p><em>Flash</em><br>
Laser. Siren. Animal sounds.<br>
These are your new name.</p>
<p><em>Try Again, Earthling</em><br>
Try again, half-pintâ&#128;&#148;the aliens are<br>
disguised as girls wearing Aqua Net<br>
and black vinyl. Try again, monkey<br>
boy or be defeated with headlock<br>
and titty twister. This machine will go<br>
silent one day so try again, juniorâ&#128;&#148;<br>
until the lights go out, until you slam<br>
tilt all the machines, until there is<br>
no such thing as a high score on earth.</p>
