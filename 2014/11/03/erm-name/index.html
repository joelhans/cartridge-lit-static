      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2014-11-03T08:00:20-06:00">November 3, 2014</time><p>Not even your goddamned grandfather can remember<br>
your name. I hate it</p>
<p>that we both own that specific brand of suffering, fucked-up<br>
familiesâ&#128;&#148;I mean what kind of broken</p>
<p>mother sends her child wilderness-bound with a backpack<br>
a pet, and a pat on the ass? God, mom,</p>
<p>Iâ&#128;&#153;m <em>eleven</em>. What I know about battles is keeping<br>
a berry tree alive past its first sprout.</p>
<p>What I know of patience is walking the long way<br>
around the tall grasses. My only risks, ledges.</p>
<p>All Iâ&#128;&#153;ve ever known of desire is possession. When he asks me<br>
to name my enemy, itâ&#128;&#153;s always after</p>
<p>someone I used to love. Whatâ&#128;&#153;s the difference?<br>
Something small and painful, Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure, unimportant</p>
<p>when it all comes down to itâ&#128;&#148;a splinter, a pebble in my shoe.<br><em>Choose</em>! I always make these decisions for you.</p>
<p>Destiny sits round in my palm. Yours is whatever foils meâ&#128;&#148;lick of fire<br>
to my tranquil green, sea lapped against</p>
<p>my single spark. I<em> want to be the very bestâ&#128;&#148;</em>and the best is only<br>
better than you. My whole</p>
<p>life alongside yours, your steps the trail to every town, your shadow<br>
the dark of every cave.</p>
<p>I know, in the end, it comes down to thisâ&#128;&#148;you and I together.<br>
On the road to victory, your body</p>
<p>locked there, looking out. In the final battle,<br>
your name tumbling from my mouth.</p>
