<p> </p>
<p>You curse him,<br>
shrug, note</p>
<p>his speed dropping<br>
two points a season</p>
<p>for the last<br>
three seasons,</p>
<p>relive the fumble<br>
in the January snow,</p>
<p>relive the shoulder injury<br>
that kept you from going</p>
<p>undefeated. You never needed<br>
him. But you wanted</p>
<p>one more 1,000 yard year,<br>
one more run</p>
<p>with the gem<br>
you discovered in the muck</p>
<p>of a fifth round video game draft.<br>
You want him to last</p>
<p>a little longer because<br>
if his knees have finally gone,</p>
<p>you have to think about your knees<br>
and the songs they sing</p>
<p>when you trade one can for another<br>
in the kitchen. Heâ&#128;&#153;s gone</p>
<p>away to spend more time with his family.<br>
When was the last time you called your family?</p>
<p>You do remember that it was family<br>
that put the controller in your hand</p>
<p>in the first place, donâ&#128;&#153;t you?<br>
The envy only second sons can know</p>
<p>pushed you to push buttons faster,<br>
to push â&#128;&#156;muteâ&#128;&#157; so mom didnâ&#128;&#153;t find</p>
<p>your hands pawing a wet<br>
controller in the dead of the night.</p>
<p>Your brother stopped beating you<br>
years ago. Your momâ&#128;&#153;s just happy</p>
<p>youâ&#128;&#153;re not dead and youâ&#128;&#153;re not asking<br>
for money that much these days.</p>
<p>Your running back moved on.<br>
Your video game grew up.</p>
<p>What happened to you? Really,<br>
Iâ&#128;&#153;m asking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>June 10, 1992</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I spent the hours punishing my brother<br>
with midair backbreakers and eating cheeseburgers.<br>
If I say it was the best day of my life,<br>
some of you will understand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do They Play Like Ryu or Guile?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When life was as simple as a button<br>
combination and a sticky cabinet,</p>
<p>this question told us all we needed to know.<br>
It was â&#128;&#156;Ford or Chevy?â&#128;&#157; It was</p>
<p>â&#128;&#156;Batman or Superman?â&#128;&#157;<br>
Does this character move</p>
<p>in arcs and circles, nothing but<br>
tornadoes, cyclones,</p>
<p>and fireballs? Or are we charging<br>
in a straight line like Hector</p>
<p>and his phalanxes? Back-Forward.<br>
Up-Down. Remember</p>
<p>when these were the only options<br>
the world gave us. Remember</p>
<p>when they felt like all the choices<br>
weâ&#128;&#153;d ever need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Wings of Liberty</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We opened beers with our teeth<br>
because we were men, and men didnâ&#128;&#153;t carry<br>
bottle openers on Spring Break.<br>
At the pier, we decided on oral sex</p>
<p>being a reciprocal thing because, well,<br>
manhood was about obligations.<br>
We spent days collecting names<br>
and numbers and faces, but at night</p>
<p>they never matched. We laid our IDs<br>
on the counters with pride and tried not to<br>
giggle into our rum because men<br>
didnâ&#128;&#153;t giggle. We were old enough</p>
<p>to know that, old enough to drink and hold<br>
a dollar between a womanâ&#128;&#153;s breasts<br>
in a strip club we could never find again.<br>
But men were explorers, and we found</p>
<p>our muse when she fell off the stage<br>
during â&#128;&#156;Air Force Ones.â&#128;&#157; She laughed;<br>
we laughed, but I wasnâ&#128;&#153;t sure<br>
who was laughing at who</p>
<p>but I didnâ&#128;&#153;t ask because men<br>
werenâ&#128;&#153;t supposed to ask<br>
too many questions<br>
in front of a naked woman.</p>
<p>She whispered promises in my ear,<br>
but before I reached for my wallet<br>
the Terran theme from <em>Starcraft</em><br>
reached my ears. I waited to see</p>
<p>if my RTS-loving stripper fantasy<br>
was going to come true, but<br>
it didnâ&#128;&#153;t. The music wasnâ&#128;&#153;t for the stage.<br>
It was the DJ playing</p>
<p>the game in the back corner.<br>
I left my muse to go talk to a guy<br>
about siege tank defense and fucking<br>
Zerg rushes. He said he was just passing</p>
<p>the time, and we traded strategies<br>
while we watched space marines<br>
put flamethrowers to alien parasites<br>
instead of watching live</p>
<p>nude girls. The DJ joked about watching<br>
the wrong thing. I told him naked girls<br>
werenâ&#128;&#153;t new to me. I lied. But I was honest<br>
about the Zerg. Without tanks, they were tough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>After I Heard Another White Woman at the Bar Talking About Michael Vick and theÂ Death Penalty</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mike, I wanted to hit her<br>
with a history lesson<br>
about black men</p>
<p>never getting what they deserve<br>
from the law.<br>
But sheâ&#128;&#153;ll go to OJ,</p>
<p>Iâ&#128;&#153;ll go to Emmett Till,<br>
Sheâ&#128;&#153;ll say I canâ&#128;&#153;t think<br>
of what itâ&#128;&#153;s like to lose</p>
<p>a pet and Iâ&#128;&#153;ll say<br>
she canâ&#128;&#153;t understand because she doesnâ&#128;&#153;t<br>
have a black dick between her legs</p>
<p>and America around her neck<br>
and sheâ&#128;&#153;ll say itâ&#128;&#153;s not the same<br>
and thatâ&#128;&#153;s the only thing weâ&#128;&#153;ll agree on</p>
<p>before her boyfriend shows up<br>
with a shot and a shrug for everyone.<br>
Thing is, Mike, I wanted to hit you, too,</p>
<p>years before the first shovel<br>
touched your backyard<br>
in Virginia. But it wasnâ&#128;&#153;t because of the rape</p>
<p>stands and electrocutions; it was because you ran<br>
circles around my linebackers on <em>Madden 2004</em>.<br>
You took away my safety</p>
<p>blitzes and zone coverages.<br>
If you finished the game, I was finished,<br>
so I hit you every play.</p>
<p>I hit you on run plays.<br>
I hit you on pass plays.<br>
I grinned every time</p>
<p>your virtual body broke<br>
and my opponents turned into Priam<br>
weeping over Hectorâ&#128;&#153;s corpse</p>
<p>or some other Trojan father whose son caught<br>
a spear with his throat.<br>
They didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to go on without you</p>
<p>as their leader. The contest wasnâ&#128;&#153;t worth<br>
the dollars on the coffee table<br>
if you werenâ&#128;&#153;t standing.</p>
<p>They would swear they learned<br>
to never gamble their future<br>
on the shoulders of one man again.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the world care<br>
about a black body so much,<br>
even if I wanted to break it.</p>
