      <time class="entry-time entry-time-large" datetime="2014-06-30T08:00:41-05:00">June 30, 2014</time><p>In the middle of a church camp cottageâ&#128;&#148;blankets muffling the rattle of windows, socked feet muting the floorboards moaningâ&#128;&#148;I lean in and push my voice through an old T-shirt stretched over a microphone. <em>Oh, Axys.</em></p>
<p>He has dueled with the Dark One. His faith has cured a drought, a blight across the land brought on by the hopelessness and despair of my people. I donâ&#128;&#153;t need to be told. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve known the story for years. <em>You are our hero.</em></p>
<p>Years ago, after a show, David inked an e-mail address onto the back of my hand in permanent black: thethirteenvoices@. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t scrub hard in the shower, let the shadow of his name linger for days.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Axys.</em> He wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t know me from Eve. But when he stops in front of me, mouses over the halo hovering above my head and presses his forefinger downâ&#128;&#148;<em>click</em>â&#128;&#148;I need him to understand what he means to me. To all of us. <em>You are our hero.</em></p>
<p>Years ago, in a sanctuary, David pressed his hand into the soft arch beneath my ribs, made me aware of my body, how I was using it. â&#128;&#156;From here,â&#128;&#157; he said. <em>Oh, Axys.</em></p>
<p>The song came harder then through my rounded mouth, from somewhere deeper, vibrations hard enough to make his fingers tingle. And God help me, I was praising the Lord. You are our hero.</p>
<p>â&#128;&#156;Can you say it lessâ&#128;¦like you want him?â&#128;&#157; David asks. He grins and toggles a switch, adjusts his earphones, and I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Davidâ&#128;&#153;s right. Itâ&#128;&#153;s nothing personal. When I open the door into the heat of July, one of the other girls will walk in, grin at him, say a line, then say it again. Filling voices David canâ&#128;&#153;t throw himself. A litany of praises for the redeemer.</p>
