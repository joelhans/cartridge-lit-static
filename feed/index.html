<p><strong>Self Portrait As A Pokémon Yellow Playthrough</strong><br> &nbsp;<br> Professor Oak asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.&nbsp;<br> You shrug &amp; check your<br> squirming pants. Yellow<br> ears pop out. Today,<br> gender is electric.&nbsp;<br> Stormy, even. Filled with<br> power.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Your rival asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.<br> You say, water gun.&nbsp;<br> You say, vine whip.<br> You say that you are<br> ember, slowly pulsing<br> across health bar like<br> alarms scrambling for potions.&nbsp;<br> Today, gender hasn&#8217;t<br> evolved yet. It&#8217;s growing<br> like a bulb, like a candle<br> inside a dragon&#8217;s cave.<br> Your rival stomps away,<br> says <em>smell ya later</em>. But&nbsp;<br> does&nbsp;gender smell? You&nbsp;<br> sniff your balls, all six<br> metallic red &amp; white<br> as scentless as the&nbsp;<br> Pokémon Center.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Misty asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl<br> &amp; you say just give me&nbsp;<br> the bloody badge.<br> Brock asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.&nbsp;<br> Actually he doesn’t;<br> you Nurse no Joy. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Team Rocket asks you<br> if you are a boy or a girl.<br> You unzip your fly &amp; out&nbsp;<br> floats a ring of Clefairy. Tonight,<br> gender is metronome, is spinning<br> star, is blasting the villains off<br> into space. Into their own business.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mewtwo asks you&nbsp;<br> if you are a boy or a girl<br> &amp; you say that you have trapped<br> legends in pills, swallowed myths<br> like candy, like tongue is wild<br> grass where monsters live.<br> You say that the gender of one&#8217;s<br> birth is irrelevant. Gender isn&#8217;t the<br> gift of life, but the wrapping paper<br> &amp; the bow. It&#8217;s the box inside the<br> PC, pixel deposits incubating in<br> cyberspace.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You ask Mewtwo<br> if they are a boy or a girl &amp;<br> they say &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;No.&#8221; </p>

<p><strong>094.
Gengar</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;Should you feel yourself
attacked by a sudden chill, it is evidence of an approaching Gengar. There is
no escaping it. Give up.&#8221; – Pokémon Moon</p>



<p>During the seventh lunar month, you must never turn your head back when the shadows call your name. They want to steal it. They want what comes with your name. Keep walking straight. Even if fog tickles your breath. Even if fingers brush against shoulders.</p>



<p>Yet in the day, they call you by a different name. The name drags its hair across gravel. The name chatters &amp; contorts. The name wears a thin white dress. The name drips across your spine like wax. The name tugs at your clothes with coffin-stained nails. Begs you to look it in the eye. It does not want offerings of incense or burnt Hell notes. Instead it is a <em>getai</em> song, constantly screaming in your head. Instead, they call you by a name you wish to forget, a corpse you haunt. They spin syllables that slither around your soul. When you turn around to answer, you feel the joss-sticks die. Your soul, a mote of ash in the wind. You answer the name that is not yours &amp; forget how to live. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>778.
Mimikyu</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;After going to all the effort of disguising itself, its neck was broken. Whatever is inside is probably unharmed, but it&#8217;s still feeling sad.&#8221; – Pokémon Sun</p>



<p>You are still trying to name
yourself, still scribbling on your tombstones, still threading through sutures.
You are partition &amp; parenthesis. You are still trying to remember your
myths, untangling knots of flesh &amp; fate. You are folklore &amp; family curse.
You self-exorcist.</p>



<p>When a man touches you, does he see a twinkling pixie, or a meat mannequin? What colour does he see in your irises? Whose voice does he hear? Which cheekbone catches the light? Will his impish smile lead to nowhere? Will his fascination fade at sunrise, like every other boy before him? Or will he want to store you in a jar? When the crypt of your neck cracks, will he flee from the mogwais within? What does he want from you? Your ghost-parts, your fairy-parts, or the parts that are neither?</p>



<p>The mirror stares back every day. You don’t know what shade you’re looking at. You don&#8217;t know how skin feels like. Only silk. Only chiffon. You don&#8217;t know how a man&#8217;s tongue tastes like. Does it lick like lace? You pull at the seams of your parts. You don’t know which part needs a cross-stitch. Maybe you need a lock of hair. Maybe you need the spell of someone else&#8217;s fingers. Maybe you’re fine with not knowing. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At dusk they moved through a landscape littered
with megafauna skeletons. Sand polished the bones and sifted into every crevice
on their bodies—between eyebrow hairs, into ear whorls, within clothing
creases. Huge jaws half-sunk in sand snapped at random, mandibles interlaced on
the squeak of something living, though neither of them saw anything move over
the tall dunes except tarantula-sized crickets which fell into holes at their
approach. Clumps of grass and scrubby bushes waited for the rains to bloom.</p>



<p>When they left the oasis that morning, others
walked alongside them, canteens sloshing against their legs, clear voices
singing harmonies. As the hours passed, the footprints faded. Most travelers
circumnavigated the dunes. He argued that traveling the mountain pass would add
weeks to their journey, and he wanted to cross the river to the valley town
before the river swelled with spring rain. With reluctance, they agreed. After
all, they told themself, getting a choice spot at the craft market would increase
sales of the hand-spun yarn and whittled dolls they carried. When he knew he
was going to get his way, he leaned in, held their arm, told them that in the
desert&#8217;s largest ribcage he would transform the cave jewel into the most
powerful sword in the realm. They wanted to believe him, but they were used to
the glass castles of his stories. </p>



<p>They pressed onward, toward the highest dune.
Wind formed ripples on the ridges which they destroyed with every step. When
they miscalculated trajectories of least resistance, the west-fading sand
scalded their palms. Tiny black beetles, barely larger than the sand
themselves, flailed in the avalanches created when they rested. They imagined
themself like the beetles trying to skate through the unforeseen. He kept turning
back to look at them. They tried to breathe against convulsing lungs, gave the
thumbs-up sign, and drank some water, hoping that if they pretended everything
was okay, it would be. Sand stuck in the dry cracks at the corners of their
lips. </p>



<p>They climbed the flanks of the Star Dune and
stood at its peak. On high, they noted landmarks on the map. The horizon hinted
at the valley. Below them, vertebrae the size of tires rested in a line. Dark
shapes floated across the sky, mirrored over the earth. In the distance,
thunder rumbled, and the breeze turned violent. They belly-crawled to avoid
lightning. When the gap between rumbles and flashes quickened, they curled up
on their packs. </p>



<p>Together they sheltered in the ribcage, the one
they meant to find, each rib big around as a cathedral column and casting
unearthly shadows. They sat with their backs against the largest rib and
covered their heads with fabric until the sand died down. He grinned and took
the prismatic shard from his pack. They loved his grin. Holding it, he walked
into the center of the ribcage, where it shape-shifted into an enormous purple
sword. In his excitement, he swung it, spinning and feinting, deep in battle
with an imaginary foe. They hugged their chin to their knees and watched. </p>



<p>As he spun, he mistimed and smashed the sword
into a rib. It stuck. They took turns pushing and pulling with combined weight.
No luck. Long after night fell, they hung their tentcloth from the blade, tying
the cloth edges to the other ribs. In sleep, they faced each other, their
foreheads, knees, and feet touching, packs under their heads. Sandy breeze
weighed down the cloth they wrapped around themselves. </p>



<p>All night they dreamed of escape from the belly of a cyclopean beast. He was there, too, his impish eyes above the edge of his scarf, mashing his feet into the muck as though stomping grapes. Their feet stuck in a churning mass of half-masticated flesh and meteoric stoats. Acidic moisture condensed on the walls of skin. When they tried to climb out, they gained purchase only to slip and crash. In dreamtime they melted into skeletons still trapped.</p>



<p>When the two of them woke, it was to vulture screeches and the sound of tiny bones clinking through a grate. In the night the towers migrated. Gathering dew from the tentcloth, they poured it into a bottle. In the light, the sword looked smaller than before. Onward they trekked, toward the town on the other side of the desert. They made a pact to not look back at the sword. On the next rise, he broke it. </p>

<p><strong>ENTERTAINMENT | GAMING</strong></p>



<p>An
immersive, disturbing escape from unreality</p>



<p>By TED
ZACHARIAS</p>



<p>Friday,
November 7, 2031, 4:48:50 PM EST</p>



<p>ALBATROSS</p>



<p>Developer
and Publisher: Slipstream Games, Inc.</p>



<p><em>[Mr. Zacharias, who has returned to Stanford University to pursue
a master’s degree in computer science, sold the video game rights to the story
of his imprisonment in the Labyrinth to Slipstream three years ago. He served
as a fact-checker but was otherwise uninvolved in game development. He declined
compensation for this article. —Ed.] </em></p>



<p>On March 21, 1963, the infamous prison Alcatraz was permanently shuttered. Located in San Francisco Bay, the desolate island fortress has become an immensely popular destination for millions of tourists.</p>



<p>As it
turned out, Alcatraz was only the beginning. A top-secret directive from the
Nixon administration led to the formation of the supermax penitentiary Labyrinth,
the direct successor to Alcatraz, deep underneath Siberia, a tiny ghost town in
the Californian Mojave Desert. In 2025, after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake
shattered the facility, I managed to escape and tell my story to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>



<p>My imprisonment
served as the basis for <em>Albatross</em>, a first-person,
total immersion (TI) exploratory game. The starting point is a familiar one for
TI fans, a cold, tiny cell with blinding fluorescent lights, accompanied by the
clank of an unappetizing-looking tray of microwaved food spat out through a
slot in a wall. I had been incarcerated in 24/7 solitary confinement for
approximately two years at this point, with an hour a week allowed for exercise
in a common room with other prisoners. Disorientation was the norm.</p>



<p>There are
no visible guards – the environment is monitored electronically through dozens
of cameras hidden behind small black domes. The only doors leading outside are
sealed shut, without even a keypad or visible lock. It’s otherwise quiet for
the first twenty to thirty minutes, giving you an opportunity to interact with
five other inmates in your area.</p>



<p>Then
suddenly, everything goes sideways. Within seconds, all of you are being
jostled around like laundry in a dryer, all while the PA system calmly instructs
everyone to return to their rooms. Lights flicker, a fiery explosion goes off, and
you black out. You wake up (again) to the wail of alarms and the harsh fumes of
electrical fires. Your fellow inmates are dead. But now, you see a pathway out.</p>



<p>Obviously, escape is your first priority. I played through the game twice, and I can say that there is a degree of randomness to the collapsing ceilings, the out-of-control fires, the presence of obstructing piles of debris, and other environmental obstacles, making each playthrough fresh.. The drones and other electronic surveillance programs pervasive in the lower floors exhibit occasional variability in behaviors, presenting dangerous, dynamic challenges. Considering that the best “weapon” you’ll find for most of the game is a rock or piece of pipe, avoiding surveillance is paramount. Taking damage is about as realistic as a game can get: no health bar or hitpoints, and your field of vision darkening, reddening, or blurring, or your haptic suit’s responsiveness declining with sufficient damage. Just a few scattered items are available to regain health or address injuries, and these take valuable in-game time to use, highlighting how <em>Albatross</em> is supposed to be played: carefully, stealthily, and efficiently.</p>



<p>From
groundbreaking in 1972 through the next half-century, the mission of the Labyrinth
evolved as successive presidential administrations assumed control and stamped
their identity on the complex. Entire wings, along with their supporting
infrastructure, sprouted like roots. The newest areas, where you begin your
travels, are deep underground and furthest away from Siberia, but also the most
high-tech. In one of the more unusual early sequences, you’ll enter a zone of
automatically moving containment rooms and hallways that fit together like a
3-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, haphazardly operated by a now-malfunctioning virtual
intelligence system. Unable to bypass this completely, you’re forced to either
identify a pattern in the building’s movements and time your own actions
accordingly, or find a method of suspending the superstructure in place.</p>



<p>Yes, this
was a real location.</p>



<p>As you
ascend, the environment and technology regress, reflecting the earlier eras in
which they were developed. In contrast to the space-age whites, grays, and
blues of the lower levels, the upper floors have a more retro look, from the
ugly orange and brown décor to the clunky-looking computer mainframes and
monitors crammed into too-small offices. Electronic deadbolts are replaced by unadorned
keyholes, combination locks, and heavy safe-like doors more fitting for a
classical Old World bank. Patrol drones and robots are exchanged for a
veritable army of armed guards and ancillary staff. Fortunately for you, most
of the guards are themselves eager to escape the facility, and sometimes a
disguise is all that’s needed to avoid their attention.</p>



<p>Having
been abducted by the US government to a heretofore unknown rendition site on
American soil was preposterous on its face. I became a credible witness due to
having brought a substantial amount of information with me during my escape. <em>Albatross</em> provides numerous ways to
accrue evidence: photographs, video/audio recordings, paper documentation,
computer drives, and more are scattered across more than 100 floors, turning
you into an investigative reporter of sorts. You’ll have to find a way to
gather the evidence, all while trying to escape, and in RPG-like fashion, your
inventory capacity has limits.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game doesn’t quantify the credibility or value of the information you carry, so you’ll have to make an educated guess as to whether it’s enough. (Slipstream says there is an internal formula for gaming purposes.) But suffice it to say that practically anything that made it into the public record, including actual declassified congressional hearings and on-the-record media interviews given by me and others who eventually came forward, is available in some format in <em>Albatross</em>. Labyrinthine activities yielded everything from DARPA’s Omnibus computer network intelligence, the successor to the “Combat Zones that See” initiative, to Operation Calm State, the domestic black-ops program sponsored by the Department of Defense and the one responsible for my imprisonment. Brush off your civics lessons: watching news programming and US history channels may well help you complete this grim task.</p>



<p>Slipstream
has advised that there’s a play timer, invisible to the player. Although
several endings are possible, based on how long it takes to escape and what you
bring with you, failure to escape before running out of allotted time always
leads to the undesirable one. Think of it this way: news of the prison break
will eventually find its way to federal authorities, who seek to cover up the
disaster by any means necessary. You’re not going to survive being swarmed by
highly-trained, masked soldiers wielding automatic weapons and explosives, or in
a truly over-the-top scenario, a tactical nuclear explosion.</p>



<p>Although <em>Albatross</em> can be run on a basic home
computer setup, the game deserves to be experienced with a VR headset, haptic
feedback suit, and a 360-degree motion detector rig. You’ll sense the chill air
of your prison, the sting and burning odor of lasers on flesh, the scorching
heat of fires, the blunt impact of falling or thrown objects, and even the
weight of your inventory. You’ll also be able to hear PA announcements,
short-range radio transmissions, and other noises in your immediate
environment.</p>



<p><em>Albatross</em> utilizes sophisticated,
deep-learning chatbot algorithms, allowing you to hold realistic conversations
with any human character in the game. (Easter egg alert: talk to the right
person in-game and you’ll learn how the game got its namesake.) Conversations
are a blend of preprogrammed scripts and spontaneity, but don’t abuse the
system too much – in other words, avoid excessive swearing or nonsensical
speech – or other characters will ignore you or even become hostile. It’s also
worth noting that Slipstream’s reputation for programming realistic human-based
NPCs remains stellar. The characters of <em>Albatross</em>
are authentic not only in behavior and speech but also appearance. Everything
from facial animations to physical movements are fluid and humanoid, generally
successful at avoiding “uncanny valley” problems that often plague TI games. I
didn’t experience any significant graphical, auditory, and other programming
glitches, even with over a dozen active characters in my sensory field.</p>



<p>For those
seeking a thrilling FPS experience, <em>Albatross</em>
isn’t for you. You’re quite literally outgunned for nearly the entire trek, as
I was, and Slipstream has hinted that excessive violence on the player’s part
will negatively impact the ending. That being said, should you choose to fight
head-on, enemy behavior programming in <em>Albatross</em>
ranks among the best in the current crop of first-person TI games, even
providing ample opportunity for in-game evolution based on your own tactics.
Prison guards and later, military units are alerted to your presence through
sight and sound – both of which also can be used for some effective
misdirection. They’ll utilize a variety of methods to hunt you down, including ambushes,
sniping from well-hidden alcoves, and liberal use of frag and gas grenades to
flush you from cover, all while coordinating their squad movements via radio.
If you happen to pick up a suitable firearm and have good marksmanship, the
enemy will even perform tactical retreats and call for reinforcements.</p>



<p>In
general, <em>Albatross</em> encourages less
combat-oriented interactions with other characters. Conversing with other
people, particularly prisoners, is an integral part of the early and middle
game. While most prison staff will attack you on sight, encounters with other inmates
provide more fodder for tactical decision-making. If they ask or you convince
them to join you, will they speed you up or slow you down? Will it be harder to
sneak around undetected? Most importantly, can they be trusted? Sometimes prisoners
can provide valuable clues during conversation, such as where to go next. Other
times, they may simply stab you in the back. Remember that your weaponry is
limited and melee damage output is rather weak, so getting into a scrape with
fellow detainees poses substantial risks.</p>



<p>Is there
replay value? Absolutely. Seeing the colossal facility in a single playthrough is
practically impossible. I obviously didn’t see the entire Labyrinth during my
time there; Slipstream took artistic liberties with the environment based on
electronic blueprints and photographs that I provided to the authorities. The
developer randomized select areas of the Labyrinth, as well as the location of
many of the items, characters, and evidence. Whether this means that every playthrough
attempt is “winnable” is unclear.</p>



<p>Some have
asked me if it’s too soon to be monetizing the story of my incarceration in the
Labyrinth. The facility itself was designated a National Historic Landmark only
last year. Jordan Johnston, the founder of Slipstream, received enormous flak
when the first preview of <em>Albatross</em>
appeared at the E3 Expo two years ago, even facing down (successfully) a
defamation lawsuit from the estates of two former US Cabinet members who
committed suicide during the Labyrinth hearings. The game also doesn’t acknowledge
what brought me to the attention of the federal government in the first place –
accusations, now disproven, that I led a so-called hacktivist group responsible
for breaking into classified networks run by the Departments of Defense and
State.</p>



<p>But judgment
isn’t what <em>Albatross</em> is about. What
the game does instead is successfully fictionalizes a landmark event in modern
American history, turning it into a dark yet necessary exploration of a
shameful past.</p>



<p>SCORE:
4.5 / 5</p>



<p>Positives:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Story closely mimics actual, publicly known events and does reasonable job of not glamorizing controversy</p><p>Game endings favor non-violent, stealthy, exploratory play</p><p>Hyper-realistic character models, visuals, sounds, and game environment and physics</p><p>Cutting-edge NPC and enemy behaviors</p><p>Multiple aspects of game are randomized, allowing for unique experience with each playthrough</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 1999, I did my best to explain what an MMORPG
was to all of the adults in my life.
There weren’t many; recently expelled from the
ninth grade, the
circle was mostly
limited to my parents and my therapist. Even within that set, I only really
had to be thorough with my Dad, to explain
why I needed to put
the monthly access
fee on his
credit card.</p>



<p>“You
create this character,” I’d tell them,
“and then it puts them in this game world,
with all these other
people who have created their
own characters. And then, whatever. You can explore
this world and play whatever
type of character you want.”</p>



<p>In the web 1.0 days of adults’ moral panic around teenagers talking about sex in chat rooms, with anonymous strangers who were sure to abduct us (the only thing anyone could conceive we’d want to do online), one question inevitably came up: “What if the other people in the game are psychos?”</p>



<p>This had to be dealt
with carefully for
me, a 14-year-old with a dark sense
of humor who constantly got into
fights with other
kids and threatened them with worse.
I was often called a psycho
myself, and after all, here
I was playing <em>Ultima Online</em>.</p>



<p>In a way, my angsty offline lifestyle was the point. I played video games as a way of escaping into another identity, and few games in late 90’s offered as complete an escape as <em>Ultima Online</em>, known to its players as UO. It offered not just an identity for my own fantasy, but one to be observed by others, who would never know me as anyone else. I wanted people to see me as a grizzled adventurer with a devil-may-care disposition, like Wolverine, not a kid in an ugly school uniform with a principal-may-care disposition who would certainly die on a tour of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. Or any chocolate factory, for that matter.</p>



<p>What would be even harder to explain was that the thing I sought an escape from was the life my family had decided was best for me: the private school life. Prior to my expulsion, I was getting bussed out of the city to attend school with my alleged social betters in the suburbs, at great expense to my parents. This, they told me, was the way to a better life for me. A life, apparently, of strip malls and overpriced chain restaurants, in a culture that despised my closeted queerness and had a very, very tenuous relationship with my Jewishness. A life spent in drab, cookie cutter houses, whose doors were always deadbolted while their inhabitants peered suspiciously through the peephole at anyone who came around.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>One of the best un-talked-about aspects of video
games is their
general lack of soul-crushing suburban sprawl.
They don’t need
it. There’s not
even anywhere to put it.</p>



<p>Your basic medieval crypto-European city in a game
like <em>Ultima Online </em>is usually small enough to cross
it end-to-end within
about five minutes.
Of course, it doesn’t fulfill
the same matrix
of purposes that real
cities do. It requires no government, no school system,
and very little
in the way
of social services. It doesn’t need
outlets for recreation, because duh, the
game itself is the recreation.</p>



<p>And it definitely doesn’t need vast swathes of oversized single-family homes, sitting on former
farmland snatched up by greedy
developers. In a single-player game
like, say, <em>Skyrim</em>, any given city only needs one available housing unit, if that. But
what if the
game is an MMO that
wants to provide its player base with the ability
to build and furnish houses
for their characters? What the hell do you do
then, when your biggest city is <em>maybe </em>the size of an Ikea store?</p>



<p>As it happened, UO was the first game to answer this question. Especially in its early days, in-game achievements tended to be ethereal and fleeting. Whatever treasures you found on your adventures would only be yours until you were inevitably killed and your corpse looted by whoever happened to be around when you bit it. This made houses an extremely attractive concept. You could secure a house, and any chests or decorations inside, with unpickable locks. Whatever you put in your house was definitely <em>your shit</em>, which was never quite true for whatever you carried on your person.</p>



<p>Where to put these houses? UO’s solution was simple: since there was no room in the cities, they made the unsettled land outside them available instead. You had to buy a house deed from an NPC vendor in town, picking from about a dozen styles, then find a large enough patch of empty ground somewhere in the wilderness. Double-click the deed, target your chosen spot, and boom! You are now housed.</p>



<p>The problem was that, even with the entire country
of Brittannia available, there just wasn’t enough space. As soon as house
placement was enabled,
most of the game world
became one giant suburb. The bulk of the play-space that we were
paying ten 1999
dollars a month
for vanished. Instead of venturing through the
untamed countryside, with
no idea what
might lie on the horizon, we now found ourselves weaving through a vast, cookie
cutter house labyrinth.</p>



<p>The problem was scale. At its peak,
UO had around 250,000 active
subscribers; roughly the population of Buffalo, New York. To cross Buffalo
end-to-end, you’re in for a 10-mile hike,
3 ½ hours at a good
clip. Not only
is it a much longer
cross-town hoof than
any UO city,
it’s probably hundreds of times larger than the entire
country of Brittannia.</p>



<p>Even with all those players
divided between a couple dozen servers, there was enough demand
for
houses to render
them virtually priceless. San Francisco real
estate had nothing
on Brittannia. If you
were unwilling to pay real
world currency for
a house on eBay (probably because you were
at least a little
bit worried that
there might be a Hell),
you had to play UO basically as a full-time job, grinding out gold
for hours upon
hours every day,
in order to buy one.</p>



<p>Having a house
was one of the ultimate in-game achievements. You
had to be a dedicated player for years
before you even
had a shot at it.
The irony of this was
that, once you
had a house, there was almost
nothing to actually
do in it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In 2009, ten years after my first existential battle with the hellscape of Midwestern suburbia, I found myself, every day, riding in the back of a coworker’s car through the same endless miles of subdivisions. The houses usually did not even cast shadows, thanks to the unbroken cloud cover of central Ohio’s fall and winter months. Far from the mail-order version of country life that the fossil fuel economy envisioned, they felt more like a cartoonishly sad prison for money: rows and rows of giant, neutral-toned cells under one big ceiling the color of concrete.</p>



<p>We were door-to-door canvassers for Save the Children, or the ACLU, or whatever other non-profit had hired us to jailbreak suburban money for them that quarter. Nobody was happy to see us, especially when we accidentally knocked on their door twice in the same evening, which happened surprisingly often.</p>



<p>In our defense, it was very difficult to tell visually if we had already been to a certain house. Just like in 90’s UO, they all conformed to a small range of styles, and they were all decorated from the same catalogue of accoutrements; after all, everybody bought their stuff from the same Target or Walmart up the road. Recognizing a <em>Welcome Friends </em>doormat, or the <em>No Solicitors </em>sign on a door, didn’t mean anything when half the houses on the street had the same one</p>



<p>At the end
of every shift,
we’d pass the
same neighborhood in the opposite direction, having taken in six hours
of vitriol, cynicism, and misery from the people
who lived there.
I’d almost feel guilty, leaving them behind.
Like we were
marooning them, in those bleak,
angry houses, sitting
on their shitty, everyday-low-priced dragon
hoards. I’d watch
them disappear in the rearview
and think about how this was the best thing
to do in the suburbs:
leave.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The biggest difference between the Columbus suburbs in 2009 and the UO suburbs in 1999 was the strangely open-door nature of UO’s prefab dwellings. Despite the ability to lock other players out, most homeowners left their front doors open for anyone who pleased to wander in. It made sense; other than extra storage space, all you could really use it for was a personal museum.</p>



<p>The security of houses meant
you could put your most treasured items
on display without
fear of theft. Generally, all you or anyone could
do with these
treasures was look
at them. Most
of the game’s coveted “rares”
were pure set-pieces, notable only for the fact that there
were so few of them: things like a whip,
or a deck of cards,
or a horse bridle, that
seemed like they
should have some
kind of function, but
didn’t. The early
days of UO were full
of these seemingly half-finished or abandoned features, which,
at least for me, was part of the charm.
But it also meant that the absolute
apex of the in-game economy was centered
around things that had no use, other
than bragging rights.</p>



<p>A place in UO’s suburbs,
when you got right down to it, was largely
a way to tell everyone passing by,
<em>look how much time
I have spent
here; look how
much gold I have, how
dedicated I am to this world. </em>All that time,
all that gold,
just to put
a summary of your gaming
experience into your
very own online money prison.</p>



<p>A curious player
working their way
through the overbuilt countryside had access
to shrine after shrine,
dedicated to each individual homeowner’s unique <em>Ultima Online </em>experience. The
true suburban bleakness of it was the fact that all of those
experiences were the same one: the one that led to
getting a house, by grinding
away in dungeons, chasing gold and rares (or not doing
those things, but paying real-world currency to other people
who had). Just
like the real
suburbs, everybody had
the same shit. Your
digital dragon hoard,
in a world where another
whole-ass dragon spawned
every few minutes.</p>



<p>I went off to college in ‘03, new owner of an Apple computer, unable to run UO or any other MMO except Everquest (which, ehhh). I left behind a game that I had watched, for years, try and fail to form a fully coherent play experience. I had loved most of its clumsy experiments to that end: the hideous, buggy 3D client that made people look like weird aliens, and the new monsters designed by <em>Spawn </em>creator Todd McFarlane, which looked like they’d been copy-pasted in from, like, a <em>Call of Cthulhu </em>game. But none of these had addressed the homogenized, consumeristic feel that the housing system had lent Brittannia, and over time, it felt less and less like the kind of escape I had sought as a 14-year-old private school fugitive. Leaving UO, in the end, felt like a relief; after all, that’s the best thing you can do in the suburbs. </p>



<p>I departed for the East Coast, to go try and be someone else. For real, this time. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One
day your daughter stops growing up. You notice right away. Her fingernails are
the same exact length that they were yesterday. You count her eyelashes, you
count the freckles on her cheeks, you count her teeth. All the same. She is two
years old.</p>



<p>When you were pregnant, other mothers would tell you that the baby stage was the best. You and your child, raw together in a bright, new world. They told you to savor those moments, that you’d miss them once they’d passed. But even after she was born, you couldn’t wait for your baby to grow up. You ached for the day when she’d be old enough to speak. Old enough for you to teach her things. Like how to catch a Woodskip in the secret woods, or how to pan gold from the lakes, or how to make friends with the Krobus in the tunnels beneath the cemetery. </p>



<p>You’d spent your life tilling fields, fending off the encroaching weeds and fallen logs, looking for ways to grow your tomatoes fatter, your grape vines vinier. You’d raised buildings. Incubated eggs in beds of hay. You’d taken your sword and pickaxe into the caves, found the end of every secret passageway. All you knew was a life of ambition and forward movement.</p>



<p>On the day your daughter stops growing up, she spends an hour staring at a beam of light traveling across the floor. You watch her from the kitchen and try to make a mental list of every word she knows. The average two-year-old can speak about seventy words. Does your daughter know more than that? Less? Are there words you don’t know to count? Maybe ones she’s spoken only to herself, alone at night in her bed.</p>



<p>You decide not to worry yet. Maybe this is just a phase she is going through. Maybe all children stop growing up at some point, and then start up again. Like a plant hibernating in the cold.</p>



<p>Summer moves forward. Your daughter dashes through the house like a bird caught in a gale. Every morning you count her freckles, measure the length of her hair. One night, after her bath, you trim one of your daughter’s thumb nails with a pair of scissors. You want to prove that your daughter is still capable of change, or capable of being changed. You trim the nail so short that you accidentally nick the skin. As your daughter wails, you dab at the blood with a tissue. You kiss the top of her head and apologize until she’s lulled to sleep and you can tiptoe to your own bed. The next morning, the first thing you do is go to your daughter to check the cut. But it has healed. Or, more accurately, it has completely disappeared. The trimmed nail is exactly the same length as it had been the morning before. You touch the spot on her skin where you’d made her bleed. She doesn’t flinch at all.</p>



<p>Autumn
comes. Your daughter falls asleep in her tiny, four-post bed, like a sea maiden
floating out to sea. Spiders flee indoors to build cobwebs in corners. Leaves
change colors from the inside out. Your house fills with pumpkins big and small,
and your daughter likes to stack the smallest into tall, teetering towers. All
day, she wanders around the house in nothing but a diaper, completely
unashamed. Unaware of the difference between being naked and being clothed.</p>



<p>Later,
raking leaves around the chicken coop, you think of a time when you were
fifteen and drunk for the first time at a party. Your ride had left without you,
and you had to call your mother to pick you up. Sitting in the front seat of
her car, you felt exposed and embarrassed in your tank top, your mother’s eyes
on the lacy bra visible through the fabric. You’d bought the bra with your own
money at the mall last Saturday, had been hiding it under your bed, afraid of
what your mother would think if she found it while putting away the wash. </p>



<p>Halfway
home, you puked into the backseat. <em>Ugh,
I’m sorry, mom</em>, you said. <em>I’ll clean
it up. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. </em>The worst part was your mother’s silence. She
didn’t speak until you were home and she was tucking you into bed. She hadn’t
tucked you in for years. Your vision spun, and all you could do was look up at
her as she placed your arms under the covers and propped your head up with
pillows. As she turned off the lights, she paused in the doorway and sighed. “I
wish I still had my baby,” she said, and closed the door behind her.</p>



<p>You
understood in that moment that you were no longer the daughter your mother
wanted, had in fact replaced her. Your mother had wanted a child, but she
didn’t want this adult you were becoming. Every day you grew farther away from
the fantasy she’d had of you. This thought made you sad for yourself but also
sad for your mother.</p>



<p>When you learned you were pregnant, you swore to never mourn the versions of herself your daughter left behind. You wouldn’t mourn the sound of her laughing alone in her crib in the early morning. You wouldn’t mourn her letters to Santa Claus, signed in awkward cursive. When your daughter got her first tattoo, you wouldn’t mourn the skin she covered up. You wouldn’t just love these new versions of your daughter, you’d welcome and like them.</p>



<p>But
now you find yourself mourning all of these future versions of your daughter
you will never meet. Your mother had wished for a forever-baby, and now her
wish is your curse. </p>



<p>Fall
becomes winter. Every day for the past six months, your child has woken up as
the same child. On the morning of the first snow, you bring handfuls of white
snow into the house and your daughter eats it. Stuffs her mouth full, then
cries when it melts and dribbles down her chin.</p>



<p>You read in a child development book that children don’t start growing kneecaps until age three. That toddlers are ambidextrous. That two-year olds don’t understand yet that their mind is separate from other people’s. </p>



<p>You
understand now that this is how it will always be. This isn’t a phase. You will
grow old, and your baby will continue to be your baby. Continue to stack pumpkins
like blocks, continue to take handfuls of snow in her fists and expect it to
stay snow forever. Just as you can count on the Krobus to always be in the
sewers, and the dwarf to always be in the caves, and the wizard to always be in
his tower. You hope those other mothers were right. You hope the baby stage
will be the best.</p>



<p>You
wipe away the melted snow dripping down your daughter’s neck with the end of
your sleeve. Then you take her hand. You notice that her fist fits perfectly
inside your own, like a nut inside a shell. </p>



<p>“Want
to see more snow?” you ask your daughter.</p>



<p>“Snow,”
she says.

Neither of you are
wearing shoes or jackets, but you lead her outside onto the front porch anyway.
The warmth of the house still sticks to your skin and your clothes, and it will
be a minute before you feel the cold. Your daughter reaches out, waiting for
the snow to find her open palm, and you do the same.

<p style="text-align:left">  At crux of the rainbow: Blackness.<br> The King must fade in twinkling church<br> organ and WWF belt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Must be decked in<br> purple fractal templed column<br> cuffed with starched puffed renaissance. Crossed<br> forearms. Spanx glitter blue towering over<br> &nbsp;<br> the tiny green bud of you.<br> It was not a dream.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left"> Even as you roll through the earth, he follows<br> crowned in goatee. Sprawling amoeba frame.<br> Monosyllabing your efforts: <br> <br> <em>Are you sad now? Attaching yourself</em><br> <em>to your first?</em><br> &nbsp;<br> <em>Should we write it in your journal, little Prince?</em> </p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>3</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left"> You are 16 and vacuuming every small<br> pink brand in the living room:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the short yellow screw<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chestnut<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the caramel voxel that never melts<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the memory card  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imagining<br> &nbsp;<br> this is what will blur the world finally<br> into the size of a man. Anything<br> &nbsp;<br> that scampers. Roll it up before it runs. </p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>4</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left"> You are coaxing the roof from a place of worship<br> with Sisyphus gizmo. The company men<br> squirm. The dog never stops wagging you are <br> &nbsp;<br> inches away<br> from plucking a sick catamaran from the stiff<br> shape of a lake. This is when the rainbow overtakes you<br> &nbsp;<br> spreading wide from the King’s open mouth. From his soft<br> gloved right hand. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>1. </p>



<p>Miss Pacman, bulimic, throws up cherries and
pretzels off-screen. Pacman, afraid of what he knows, eats. Both of them think
they are full but continue to wander the corners of their lonely dark yard,
looking for any overlooked power pellets. </p>



<p>2. </p>



<p>In one version of this story, Pacman is a
salaryman. Pacman eats and works in capsule hotels. We can assume this because
he is rarely seen on screen with Miss Pacman and his levels are small, tight
like a commute. Pacman makes a competitive salary yet his ghosts are never
satisfied. Pacman is always running, always eating, always tired. Pacman drinks
every night with his coworkers, binging on cherries and wondering if he will
ever achieve happiness.</p>



<p>3. </p>



<p>Pacman thought Blinky was his friend until
Blinky bit into his shoulder, and nothing was the same after that. </p>



<p>4.</p>



<p>The first time Pacman met Miss Pacman she was
eating a cake. She was a few booths down at the local Denny’s. Pacman could
relate; he ate all sorts of things: fruit, deserts, ghosts, people’s time.&nbsp; Everyone knows what it feels like to eat and
be filled, to need to be filled. Maybe they could get along, Pacman thought. </p>



<p>Miss Pacman ate beautifully. What did she enjoy,
Pacman wondered—what does any woman enjoy?&nbsp;
</p>



<p>He studied the cake, the way it folded under her
fork like linens. </p>



<p>Was she also eating and eating, trying to be
filled? Or with that cherry-red bow and perfect lipstick, had she found an
answer Pacman had missed? </p>



<p>Maybe I should join her, Pacman thought, but
remained in his booth and continued to watch. </p>



<p>5.</p>



<p>Miss Pacman’s dementia is getting worse. She
asks her husband: who are you? She finds herself running into walls, forgetting
where she is going. She is off-screen because she is tired. Her husband eats to
forget. He fills himself with fruit to keep himself busy. Idle men get eaten by
ghosts. He runs until he gets tired and then his memories eat him. </p>



<p>Whenever Pacman tries to run off-screen he
loops. Pacman is running in circles.</p>



<p>6. </p>



<p>Miss Pacman wasn’t Pacman’s first lover. There
was Pinky, Blinky, Inky and then Clyde. Even though those relationships ended
years ago, they linger behind Pacman wherever he goes. He doesn’t want Miss
Pacman to know this, yet she sees them too. She sees them in how quick Pacman’s
pace is, how he answers her questions briskly, how he always is looking over
his shoulder, as if&nbsp; being followed.</p>



<p>7. </p>



<p>Pacman wonders what happened between him and
Clyde. Years ago, they were friends when they suddenly drifted apart. They
tried to talk, but it felt forced, like a ritual. Pacman thinks about what he’d
say to Clyde, if they were sitting down in a café, catching up. Clyde’s never
been a man of many words, but neither has Pacman. He likes to think that
whatever they once had can be fixed. When it’s late at night and the world
feels overwhelming and too large to be consumed, Pacman thinks about this. </p>



<p>8.</p>



<p>Pacman has dreams where he and Clyde still talk,
where Blinky apologizes for biting him, where there’s closure with Pinky, and
Inky forgives him for being a juvenile jerk back in the day. Pacman has so many
dreams about his past that he begins to feel the separation between his past
and present selves. He walks in parks, picking up all the trash on the ground,
as if in a trance. Miss Pacman will find him in the middle of a park without
his shoes, sitting on a park bench. Miss Pacman has tried to express her worry,
telling Pacman he should consider seeing a therapist. Pacman tries to tell her
that everything is fine, but after driving him home from the park that day,
Miss Pacman won’t take no for an answer. </p>



<p>9.</p>



<p>After several years of goal-setting with his
therapist, Pacman has finally decided to eat his own ghosts. He has prepared
for this day. For years he has gone through exposure behavioral therapy, has
chased hypothetical ghosts for practice. He faces them today, and they become
small. He eats them, and they disappear briefly, but return the next day. After
several days of this, Pacman gets tired. What will it take to make his ghosts
disappear? <em>It’s funny, </em>he tells his
therapist, <em>how one minute, I feel in
control, and the next, I’m overpowered by the same fears as before. It’s like
my life is a never-ending cul-de-sac. </em></p>



<p>10. </p>



<p>In Pacman’s childhood, his father asked him
every day what he was going to do, and provided unsolicited answers.</p>



<p>Pacman’s father never stood still, but was
always in-transit. </p>



<p>Pacman’s father was never on-screen, but was a
necessary part of the story. </p>



<p>Pacman still thinks about his father whenever he
goes from cherry to orange to cake. He wonders what his father would think of
his dietary choices, if his father would approve of his career choice as a
professional food-gatherer. <em>We’re not in
the stone-age,</em> his father would say. <em>And
even if we were, women are the gatherers, men are the hunters. </em></p>



<p>Pacman’s never been much of a hunter. He prefers
long walks at the beach and conversations with good friends. </p>



<p>It has taken Pacman years to acknowledge that he
doesn’t need his father’s approval.</p>



<p>Even so, his father’s words trail behind him
continuously, and make him second-guess where he’s going. </p>



<p>11.</p>



<p>For as long as he can remember, Pacman’s been
bullied. He never turns around to see their faces but hears their voices
ricochet in his head. As an adult, Pacman knows that they have no power over
him, but he still finds himself on instinct running. </p>



<p>12.</p>



<p>Pacman is remembered as the top man of his
class. Everyone remembers Pacman. Voted “most likely to suceed” as well as
“most likely to eat all cakes in sight.” Pacman always had his shit together.
Pacman got the hot girl. Pacman became an arcade classic. Pacman is the
American dream.</p>



<p>At his high school reunion, Pacman opens up
after a few drinks. Miss Pacman remembers how he was in the car ride here:
nervously tucking his stomach into his pants, over and over, checking his hair
in the mirror. </p>



<p>But now, he laughs again. The world is in Blue
Mode, and Pacman is eating it all up. He recreates the Pacman everyone
remembers. </p>



<p>But Miss Pacman knows this is only brief:<br>that this is just a game, a show,<br>that the ghosts will return,<br>that we are all cycling the same floor of our lives, <br>looping in new rooms to deceive ourselves <br>into thinking we have changed something <br>by our own strength.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After playing hours and hours and hours of a so-called “open world” game that simulated a wilderness realm in which I was an outlaw and member of a gang of men and women and children who lived together in a camp on a wooded plateau not far from a town called “Valentine”; and after I had learned to ride a horse and that I needed to maintain a good relationship with this horse by frequently patting it and saying, “yes that’s a good boy” and brushing his mane and feeding it “classic oatcakes”; and after riding my horse through the woods and smashing into trees and flying out of the saddle; and after feeding the horse something called “horse reviver” and myself a “miracle tonic” to restore our health; and after getting drunk at the local saloon and walking in on a harlot and cowboy having sex in one of the rooms; and after tracking deer through snowdrifts in an alpine forest and bringing one down with the bow I’d been carrying by sandwiching my torso between the handle and string; and after skinning the deer by unzipping its pelt from the marbled musculature of its body, as I would do every time I hunted and killed animals in this world, a collection that would include jackrabbits, elk, foxes, mule deer, black bear, and grizzly bear; and after visiting a camp where I lived with other outlaws, to eat stew or drink whiskey and watch the firelight cast its shadows upon the faces of my friends, who sang ditties like “ring dang do, now what is that, got a hole in the middle and it’s split in two”; and after fudging a bank robbery and failing to lasso the man guarding the caboose on a moving steam train; and after marveling at distant mountain vistas that called to mind the Rocky Mountains; and after rescuing a miscreant from prison by yanking a hole in the jail wall; and after various shootouts with lawmen and locals and bounty hunters; and after accidentally discharging my firearm in a city that resembled New Orleans and being set upon by constables who shot me dead; and after pouring moonshine on the leaves of a tobacco field and setting it ablaze with a kind of Molotov cocktail, and pausing to watch cinders ride air currents like demonic fireflies; and after robbing and deciding to choke rather than simply beat a few random folk in back alleys; and after lassoing and hog-tying a random stranger who, after I’d stowed him on the back of my horse, exclaimed, “Jiminy cocksuckers!”; and after hijacking and stealing stagecoaches and Conestoga wagons and delivering them to a barn where a balding man with long stringy side hair purchased my stolen goods, no matter how poor the condition; and after eating cans of baked beans and peaches and logs of salted beef and crackers and hunks of bread and cheese and cooking game with a knife held over a campfire; and after entering random houses and stealing pocket watches and rings and tonics of all varieties and shooting homeowners who gave me shit and then attempting to track down witnesses and murder them before they could tattle to local deputies; and after helping strangers unlock bear traps from their legs or suck snake venom from thighs; and after pausing to note rays of sunlight shooting like projector beams through evergreens; and after riding through fog and rain and snow; and after attacking a group of Klansmen holding some kind of initiation ritual deep in the woods and getting my ass handed to me; and after my world fading to black and the word “dead” appearing in a red saloon-style font, I decided that perhaps I ought to pause gameplay and get some fresh air, so I donned a bodysuit that, in real life, makes me look sort of like a Power Ranger, then climbed upon my bike and rode off the plateau where I lived, down into the valley, where I began to marvel, as I had upon encountering the resplendent facsimiles offered by the game I’d recently been playing, at the idiosyncrasies of the world through which I traveled: the fissures cracking across glittering asphalt; the way that dual cab trucks seemed to spawn, one after the other, as soon as I left the town’s limits; the dimpled surface of a stream; the waxy netting snugly fitted over hay bales; the sun streak on the wing of a crow; lichen-smudged fence posts; swirls of wood grain; the furrows of tire tread in a meadow; a branch in autumn’s webbed canopy undulating as a squirrel moved across it; a rotting IROC beneath the fallen boards of a disintegrating barn; the dusty pelt of an opossum, flattened on the road as thin as if it had been run over by a cartoon steamroller; the leaden water of a pond orbited by cattails; the tangle of a tree’s exposed roots, looking like tentacles clinging to the cleft of a mud bank, and giving the impression that this tree might at any moment get up and walk away; the rotting log cabin sadly branded with a private property slash no trespassing sign; and I couldn’t help but think to myself, every time, <em>how convincing, how oh so very real</em>.</p>
