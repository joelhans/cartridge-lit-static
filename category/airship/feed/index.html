								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Kim Stoll lives in Tucson, Arizona. She holds a BA in creative writing from Susquehanna University and an MFA in poetry from the University of Arizona. Her chapbook,&nbsp;</em>Anna Lives<em>, is available from Dancing Girl Press, and you can read her work online at&nbsp;</em>ILK<em>,&nbsp;</em>Birdfeast<em>,&nbsp;</em>Cloud Rodeo<em>, and&nbsp;</em>Alice Blue Review<em>.</em></p>



<p><em>Her&nbsp;essay,&nbsp;<a href="https://cartridgelit.com/2018/10/01/dead-or-alive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Alive,&quot; (opens in a new tab)">&#8220;Dead&nbsp;or&nbsp;Alive,&#8221;</a> appeared in&nbsp;our &nbsp;</em>Bug/Feature<em>&nbsp;Temple&nbsp;Issue. </em></p>



<p><em>Below,&nbsp;she&nbsp;talks&nbsp;with&nbsp;editor&nbsp;William&nbsp;Hoffacker&nbsp;about&nbsp;dissociation,&nbsp;poetry,&nbsp;rituals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;more.</em></p>



<p><strong>WH: How did your essay </strong>&#8220;<strong>Dead or Alive</strong>&#8220;<strong> start to take shape for you? Why did you choose to write about this video game and that particular moment in your life?</strong></p>



<p>KS: The easy answer is that one of the editors off-handedly suggested I submit something to <em>Cartridge Lit</em> and I thought to myself, “Do I have anything to say about video games?” I thought through my childhood and different games that had significance to me, and DOA was the first I thought of and the one that had the most story to unpack around it.</p>



<p>The death of my grandfather was a really significant loss in my life. At the time I wrote this essay, I had been seeing a trauma therapist, so I think I was especially in the mindset to unwrap this particular event and my response to it. I knew that disconnecting, going blank and leaving my body was a thing that I did as a coping mechanism all through my life, but before therapy I didn’t know there was a word for it and I also didn’t know how to control it.</p>



<p>So, there was this really intense, important event in my life that I just totally dissociated from and there was this video game that sort of helped me do that. I think this was something I was just ready to get into and try to unpack and the way I do that is through writing. Also, the built-in metaphor of the game title alone, <em>Dead or Alive</em>… It writes itself.</p>



<p><strong>Prior to this piece, all of your published work has been poetry. What lessons have you learned from writing poetry that serve you well as an essayist (or a prose writer in general)?</strong></p>



<p>I think my work in poetry has afforded me way more freedom in my prose writing. Poetry taught me how to just make leaps, to move on quickly. And to be terse and economical with language. To just trust readers way more. Poetry doesn’t hold your hand and explain things, and I think that can be really freeing when you write prose and you don’t feel obligated to the reader in the same way. Also, there’s the obvious stuff poetry teaches you like distilling moments into a single image, relying on imagery and metaphor, and finding pleasure in the rhythm and sonic quality of a sentence, that kind of stuff.</p>



<p><strong>What are the leading obsessions in your writing? What themes or subjects do you return to most often?</strong></p>



<p>Well, I think I earned myself the reputation of being the “dead animal girl” in my undergrad writing workshops, and it’s not untrue. I’ve written a lot about the natural world and people’s relationship to wildness &amp; wilderness. I grew up in a hunting family and return to that world a lot in my writing. I also like spooky shit. I like blood and guts in my poems. I like the idea of sound as a type of violence. Despite living in the desert, I’m obsessed with frozen landscapes, cold brutal places.</p>



<p>I guess at the heart of it all though, it’s all circling types of violence and trauma. So, even though this essay isn’t about my usual subjects it’s still in that thread.</p>



<p><strong>In 2018 you began writing seasonal Divinations on <a href="https://www.kimstoll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="your web site (opens in a new tab)">your web site</a>, in which you describe throwing bones, gathering with a coven, and other witchy things. Please describe how, when, and why you began engaging in these neo-pagan rituals (if I may call them that). What is their appeal for you?</strong></p>



<p>Wow, well. This one is complicated. I don’t want to bore readers with an essay on Why I’m a Witch Now. But, here are a few thoughts about this (sorry if it gets long!):</p>



<p>&gt;One simple answer is that I started posting these divinations as a way to force myself to write a non-work-related thing to completion at least once a season. It’s generative. I also wanted to practice divination methods and, again, this commitment of posting to my website forced me to stick with it.</p>



<p>&gt;Another factor is that in the current state of the world, I often feel totally powerless, and have these deep feelings of anger and terror and confusion. Witchy-stuff is a way to sort of deal with those feelings. There’s a reason all these witchy, “woo woo” things are having a moment right now in our culture. I think it helps people feel in control, or helps give them answers, or helps connect them with the earth or plants or the stars or the physical world around us or to something spiritual. A lot of the practices at their core are about taking time to actually be in the present moment, to slow your thoughts and focus your intentions. It’s about mindfulness. Divination in particular I think can be a type of self-therapy, it’s a vehicle through which to understand a situation and talk your way through a problem.</p>



<p>&gt;In terms of spirituality, I guess I’d say I’m an animist, though that’s not really a set of beliefs as it is just a way of being in the world. Anyway, all this witch stuff is connected to that. For those interested, I’d suggest reading the academic essay “The animal versus the social: rethinking individual and community in Western cosmology” by Priscilla Stuckey. It’s really interesting and has to do with the stories we tell ourselves, the mythologies and philosophies that have shaped our current western culture and given the state of climate change and “how things are going,” maybe there are alternative ways we could engage with the world? Maybe trying to connect to the wisdom and power of the natural world isn’t so silly? &nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;For several years, I’ve been fixated with the idea of becoming an old and powerful crone. It’s just a vibe I want to have and an aesthetic I really appreciate. I even insisted on playing a old crone in my DnD group. I guess at some point I was like, wait I can actually do that, it doesn’t have to just be a fantasy, I can hang weird plants around my house, I can make potions in a cauldron, I can curse people!</p>



<p>&gt;I took a workshop with CA Conrad on the occult and rituals, and they basically made me a witch. (I hope this gets back to them). If you’re not familiar with CA’s work you should definitely check it out. But they have these (Soma)tic Poetry Rituals, and I learned that through ritual you can kind of stop yourself from dissociating and be really present in yourself and in your writing. So, yes, this witch stuff does connect back to my <em>DOA</em>&nbsp;essay in a tangential way.</p>



<p>Also, CA talked about lion’s mane mushrooms, and though you can buy it in capsule form, you can’t find the actual mushrooms for sale in a grocery store and we don’t live in a place where you can wild harvest it, so I decided to grow it in my house and briefly got really into mushroom growing. And my house felt really witchy and weird and I was like “I’m into this. I dig this. Let’s see where this takes me.”</p>



<p>&gt;It’s fun! It’s fun to gather with friends and make stuff like candles or tinctures or wreaths or whatever and eat a ton of food. Rituals are fun and creative and good outlets for our constant state of anxiety!</p>



<p>Anyway, if ya&#8217;ll want personalized bone readings hit me up. I&#8217;m still learning, but they say practicing is the only way to get really sharp at this.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>If you could adapt any literary work into any type of video game, what work would you choose and why, and what would that game look and play like?</strong></p>



<p>Okay, yeah. Mathias Svalina does this Dream Delivery Service. He was in Tucson maybe two years ago and I subscribed for a month of dreams. He writes dreams every day and delivers them on bike to your doorstep early every morning. So, by the time I was up and leaving for work, I’d have this pink envelope stuck in my screendoor with a dream in it. The dreams are prose poems, for those not following.</p>



<p>Anyway, I’d adapt that. It would be like this: every day there’s a new five-ten minute experience you can play through. It’s one of those games where you just walk around and experience things (sorry, I don’t know video game lingo. I know there’s a word for this type of game. First-person walkabouts?). You briefly immerse yourself in a new dream reality every day and that’s it. That’s the game.</p>



<p><strong>What writing project(s) are you working on now?</strong></p>



<p>I have at least three different projects semi-started. Incubating? Maybe they’re all connected.</p>



<p>I’ve been writing a series of poems in this witch-aesthetic vein that pull a lot from Baba Yaga folktales, and there’s also some hunting &amp; shamanism stuff in there. Who knows where that is going.</p>



<p>For awhile I was writing a lot of poems about my time working in an animal shelter and about dog/human relationships in general. I own four dogs and have studied dog training and canine behavior quite a bit, so I have a lot of thoughts to work out there.</p>



<p>I also have a project started that’s connected to all this work I’ve been doing exploring my PA Dutch ancestry and, well, I guess I haven’t been back East in a few years and maybe this writing is a type of nostalgia. But also, wow! There’s this history of folk medicine/ritual healing/folk magic-type stuff among the PA Dutch! So I’ve been exploring that a lot through my reading and writing. And I feel really excited for that whole project to manifest and come together.</p>



<p><strong>What have you read recently that you want to recommend?</strong></p>



<p>Hm. Almost everything I’ve been reading lately if very specific to “research” for writing projects. I’m not sure if I’d recommend ya’ll go out and read grimoires or Russian folktales or academic essays on the Siberian Yukaghirs.</p>



<p>Oh, you know what I would definitely recommend though? <em>Crapalachia: A Biography of Place</em> by Scott McClanahan. It came out a few years ago, but I just read it this year and yeah, would highly recommend.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The weight of the controller increases. Playing becomes a Herculean effort. Muscles build in my chubby child hands, muscles I never knew I had, muscles developing from nowhere. I do this exercise in gaming weightlifting because I want to see on the big screen my Pokémon Game Boy games. <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>, specifically. I insert the Transfer Pak into the back of the Nintendo 64 controller. This heavy object serves as an emulator, enabling the two-dimensional goodness, the bland yet still strikingly vibrant colors of <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>, on the TV screen.</p>
<p>Something about the littleness of the Game Boy game blown up onto the TV makes me giddy. This game that is meant to be small, held in hand, framed within a screen the length of a finger, is reconfigured as something large. The square body of the female avatar is so much larger on the screen, where my budding sexuality, my femmeness, imagines in her step a pep, a sway, a femininity celebrated. I put the volume up as much as I remotely can to hear the iconic Pokémon music, each town and location its own score, thinking how lifelike, how grand it is journeying across this 8-bit world. The scale of Pokémon, otherwise tiny, otherwise contained between my two hands, on the big screen becomes something magical.</p>
<p>I spend entire summers playing <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Crystal </em>on the Nintendo 64 on my grandparents’ TV. It’s the only place where I can spend hours upon hours playing because in my home—well, not really my home but the rental, the cramped box we live in without any privacy, any moment to be with oneself—I have to share a TV with my brother, and the living room one is off limits. TV time is hard to come by, but in my grandparents’ house, a house where my abuelita babies me, I can have it for as long as I want. But these are just for the summers, or weekends. On most other days, my Game Boy allows me to clock in the hours upon hours of gameplay I otherwise cannot clock in at my own home. I can be in the backyard, in the woods, sitting on the porch steps. The world of Pokémon anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>In my grandparents’ house, I have a space all my own to game. I recline the chair as I want, I sit as up close as I want, I play as long as I want. I yell at the TV as loud as I need to, I throw the controller onto the couch as hard as I want, I can let my body respond to the games I play as I need it to. Something I cannot fully do in the cramped space of my parents’ house, with my shared bedroom, our shared living room, all the space I must share with so many others.</p>
<p>My grandparents’ living room is the closest thing I get to a gaming room. This kind of space is a luxury. Some of the other boys and girls in my school note how they have a game room, a special room with cool, expensive gaming chairs, the biggest screens and the best surround sound systems, all the latest consoles and equipment. They speak of these luxuries and I stay quiet, little me who comes from the Mexican part of town, the poor part of town, a neighborhood they call ghetto and dirty. They speak of their game rooms and I stay quiet, like always, like I will do for so many years because I idealize these little white children, their well-maintained neighborhoods, their big houses with game rooms. I feel intensely jealous of these boys and girls. Of the fact they have a designated space for gaming and leisure, a space carved out in the home to do what I can only do on special occasions at my grandparents’. A gaming room of their own.</p>
<p>Gaming is a form of solitude for my childhood self. A moment of respite from the antics of my family, a moment of escape from the white boys and girls I go to school with who call me fat, call me faggot, call me a dirty Mexican or a dirty Puerto Rican. That want that is being alone with oneself. We don’t frequently connect childhood with the desire for solitude. Children want to play with others, be with other children, have the attention of adults. Perhaps because I do not have my own room growing up, no space to call my own, and every Monday through Friday I experience a barrage of hatred from my classmates, at an early age I cultivate this need for solitude. A longing for an environment never had. A space in this world sectioned off just for me. For me and only me.</p>
<p>Video games give me this solitude. This being with myself. Though, like reading, this is a solitude that is not really solitude. I spend my time with my Pokémon, battling with them and healing them after, feeding them berries and giving them nicknames. It’s a form of connection, an intimacy with the unreal, a being with the incorporeal. In a world where I feel I don’t matter, where any day I can be gone and no one could care less, video games assure me that, in fact, I do matter, I am needed, my presence is essential. They—my Pokémon, my blue haired avatar, the NPCs, the storyline—need me.</p>
<p>The heaviness of the controller as I play in my grandparents’ house. The focus, the concentration, the joy. The weight in my hands is comfort. The controller’s increased dimensions, its bulkiness, the strain it demands, reminds me I am inside playing the game I often have to play outside. The game I fall in love with because it can be anywhere I take my body to, any exodus I undertake to keep on going. Here in this memory, this memory still so alive, for hours upon hours in this sunlight-soaked living room of my grandparents, screaming at the TV or gripping the controller tightly in frustration, the breeze through the front door and my grandmother cooking her rice and beans in the kitchen, is my gaming room. These memories at the turn of the century, this faraway childhood, my grandparents now gone, the closest I have ever gotten to a gaming room of my own.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In our new monthly column, “Quest Items,” Marcos Gonsalez explores the materiality of video games. Whether it be the experience of button mashing or blowing into cartridge games, using strategy guides and the literary qualities of game manuals, he examines the importance of materiality for how we think about politics, culture, and video games.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Piragüeros selling their shaved ice, older women with their custom-designed hats, the pastelito sellers giving us all that deep-fried deliciousness. These are the typical wares sold on the streets of Washington Heights, this neighborhood I call home. Unlike the rest, one Puerto Rican elder sells cartridge games on the sidewalk. A mass of cartridge games are lined up in rows on a table facing the traffic. On fair-weather days, they are open, unprotected. On days with contrary weather, they are sheathed in clear plastic, the titles still visible. NES, Sega, N64, you name the system and he has it. His shop is located across the street from my apartment, next to my local grocery store, so I pass by him frequently. I watch, and cringe, as the new arrivals to the neighborhood, a neighborhood coined “The New Williamsburg,” ask questions about the games in English as the man fumbles to answer them. Most of the time I stop, look for a minute, then resume purchasing my groceries. One day, out of curiosity, out of a will to just be neighborly, I ask him how he collected this many games. They were my sons’, he replies, and they grew up, grew out of them.</p>
<p>As much as I would like to, I don’t probe any further into this man’s life, into the history of how he amassed his collection. I settle for the smile he gives after he answers. A broad smile, a tooth or two golden capped, a depth and energy in the topmost reaches. He gives one of those smiles we give when there is more to a story, when there is a story, a story not meant for a stranger. I see his boys in the texture of his smile. Boys too macho, too grown to play video games anymore. Boys who to become men decided they no longer did such childish things. Boys who left their cartridge game collection in the apartment of their father, their father who left an island to make it in America, an America where he must sell cartridge games on the sidewalk to make ends meet because the rent spikes keep happening, the price of groceries keeps increasing, the cost of surviving keeps going up and up.</p>
<p>My assessment is unfair. I, too, grew up and left most of my games in my parents’ house. But I want those games, and someday when I have a big enough space will reclaim them. Tucked away in my childhood closet is one box holding a bunch of Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis games. These games, like the Puerto Rican viejo’s games, were not originally mine. They belonged to my brother. Like the Puerto Rican viejo who inherited his cartridge games from his children who no longer wanted them, I inherited mine from a brother who passed away at the age of twenty-one. They became mine when I was twelve because they had nowhere else to go. No one wanted them, much like the games of the Puerto Rican viejo’s children, and no one cared to have them. Relics of a dead and gone age.</p>
<p>Don’t blow that hard into it you knucklehead, my brother would say, snatching the cartridge from my hands. He would blow into it softly, hands gripping the other end gently, telling me like this, like this. So unlike him, all this softness, this boy that is a wrestler-wannabe, this boy built like a linebacker, this boy who acts first and thinks later. He’s everything to me, this boy. This boy who instills in me the love of gaming, the joy the pleasure the thrill of a controller in your hands. He is invulnerable, so I want to believe, like those many boss fights I cannot get past as a child, unbeatable, so I tell myself. I blow into the cartridges, as he would, plugging them into the console with care, as he would do, watching the screen in hopes it will light up, pixelated and alive, ready to be played. An extra life awarded.</p>
<p>For me, this box containing all these cartridge games is priceless. It is my brother. It is him beating me up in <em>WWF: Wrestlemania The Arcade Game</em>, or him guiding me through a <em>Sonic </em>game, or our coordinated combos taking down enemies in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time.</em> If he were still here, he would still be playing video games. His career as a gamer would not have ended with cartridge games, as those of the Puerto Rican viejo’s children did. He could still be a man, be an adult, and play.</p>
<p>The box full of cartridge games is more than nostalgia: it’s living memories.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what those cartridge games are to the Puerto Rican viejo across the street from me. Something more than plastic, something more than just a video game. A trip downtown to the electronics store with his boys in a graffitied subway cart. The sound of an apartment full of life. The controller in his hand on occasion playing with his kids, schooling them and getting schooled by them. Memories in the microchips, dreams fulfilled and unfulfilled in the plastic.</p>
<p>Maybe he wants to sell them because these memories, these material objects tucked away in a closet, are too hard to keep around, too much to bear.</p>
<p>Maybe he doesn’t want to be outside there on the sidewalk selling them. Maybe he has no other choice.</p>
<p>Or maybe the story is as simple as him wanting more room in his apartment. More space for him to be with himself, a space he can call his own.</p>

<p><em>Below, Knorr talks with  </em>Cartridge Lit<em> contributor Elizabeth Deanna Morris Lakes about the Nintendo marketing machine, queer and female representation, the &#8220;Mona Lisa&#8221; of gaming, and more.</em></p>
<p><em><b>I saw you do a reading from your book, </b></em><b> </b><b>Super Mario Bros. 3 </b><em><b>(</b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b>)</b><b>, at AWP in LA in 2016. Before your reading, Gabe Durham, editor of Boss Fight Books, commented that while they knew there’d be a book on </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> eventually, they hadn’t planned to do one so soon after the </b><b>Super Mario Bros. 2</b><b> book, which had come out the season before. However! Your plan was so fully realized, he couldn’t say no to your pitch. Could you talk about your initial pitch for the book and how it changed (or didn’t!) as you wrote it? </b></em></p>
<p>One of my favorite things about Boss Fight Books is that each author takes their own unique approach to game writing and creative nonfiction. This meant I felt free to pitch a very hybrid blend of personal memoir alongside in-depth journalistic and scholarly research for my book.</p>
<p>A few things changed from pitch to final draft along the way. For instance, while I was hoping to talk to a current Nintendo employee, they’re a notoriously hush-hush company so this didn’t work out. However, I was incredibly lucky to be able to speak with <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Howard_Phillips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard “The Gamemaster” Phillips</a> and <a href="https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/12/how-we-played-with-power-secret-history-of-nintendo-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gail Tilden</a>, two important Nintendo employees at the time <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> (<em>SMB3</em>) came out. Their interviews were hugely helpful for providing insight into the <em>SMB3</em> era, and into what made this particular game so special.</p>
<p>As a whole, my research process gave me an even deeper enjoyment of and appreciation for <em>SMB3</em>. When I first started writing the book, I thought I already knew every single in-game secret and Easter Egg, but my research revealed way more—like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcTV9OQMgF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">white mushroom houses</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l2Pnu9FnXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coin ships</a>, and a trick for <a href="http://protipoftheday.com/node/200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to determine</a> which direction a mushroom will veer toward after it pops out of a question mark block. I was also surprised to discover how pervasive <em>SMB3</em> has been in my life. In my pitch, I focused on my relationship with my father, who taught me to play <em>SMB3</em> before I knew how to read, and on how the game provided an outlet for my budding lesbian identity. As I wrote the book, however, I found even more connections to my own life, like the role <em>SMB3</em> played in my relationships with my little brother and with several friends.</p>
<p>Finally, as I interviewed a number of gaming experts and read dozens of reviews and analyses of <em>SMB3</em>, I became obsessed with a question that I hadn’t included in my initial pitch: how and why did this game achieve the cult status it did? Is <em>SMB3</em> truly “great,” or is all the hype just nostalgia? The answer I learned is: both. It <em>is</em> the “Mona Lisa” of gaming, as far as level design, flow state, cutting-edge features, replayability, and even music are concerned, but there are also many factors (see below) that make it a perfect object for nostalgia. And this combination is why it’s such a fondly remembered, cult-status game.</p>
<p><em><b>The question of nostalgia is a huge point in your book, as  </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> is a game that’s integrated itself into the collective consciousness of both gamers and non-gamers alike. Even I, who am notably terrible at this game, can hum the tunes and tell you all about the various enemy sprites more than I could any other game from this era. While I think it’s obvious why this game is so meaningful to those who played it rigorously (It’s innovative! Adorable! Bright!), could you talk more about how this game was able to create nostalgia for those less dedicated? Do you think there are any current games or franchises that might create this nostalgia for the youth today?</b></em></p>
<p>A perfect storm of influences makes <em>SMB3</em> so powerful as an object of nostalgia for an entire generation. First off, any beloved game or toy is going to produce intense feelings of nostalgia, because it’s associated with pleasant feelings from childhood. There’s a whole new Netflix series about this out now called <em>The Toys That Made Us</em>. But according to Phillips, <em>SMB3</em> is a particularly resonant object of nostalgia because it’s such a colorful, cartoonish, “cute” game—its joyful, goofy tone perfectly captures the innocence of youth in a really meaningful way.</p>
<p>We also remember <em>SMB3 </em>so well because it’s a masterpiece of game design. The tunes stick in your head because genius composer <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Koji_Kondo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koji Kondo</a> wrote them to do just that. You remember the enemies so well because they were engineered to be funny, adorable, and memorable—the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Koopalings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koopalings</a> are all named after rock musicians, for crying out loud! At the time of <em>SMB3</em>’s release, game developers were still a little spooked by the huge Atari Crash of 1983, so Nintendo was operating an intense quality control system. They simply weren’t putting out bad games.</p>
<p>Another huge nostalgia factor was <em>SMB3</em>’s marketing campaign, which was utterly massive. In the era of <em>SMB3</em>, Nintendo of America had recently hired a new head of marketing and significantly stepped up their strategies. The campaign for <em>SMB3</em> created an unprecedented level of hype. Eleven months after <em>SMB3</em>’s release, it was still the second highest-selling toy in the U.S., with the NES console itself in first place. The game was marketed like a Blockbuster movie, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU80R7jGanE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV commercials</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY7qEa7QJBs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV show</a>; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSxdvRoa-1k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDonald’s Happy Meal toys</a>; and a ton of merchandise, memorabilia, toys, and clothes. This was also the heyday of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Nintendo Power</em></a> magazine, the Nintendo-published magazine that served as a powerful advertising tool. <em>SMB3</em> was the first game to get its own dedicated issue <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZR5YB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategy guide</a> from <em>Nintendo Power</em>, which made everyone hungry for the game itself to come out. And we can’t forget <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEbqd2QMkuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Wizard</em></a>, a Fred Savage kids’ movie that was essentially, in the words of David Sheff, a 90-minute <em>SMB3</em> ad that audiences paid to view. What all this adds up to is that for many of us, our <em>SMB3</em> nostalgia is not only for the game itself, but also for the feeling of anticipation that led up to it.</p>
<p>Finally, the game’s timing made it essentially ubiquitous for American children. It’s easy to forget that in 1990, Nintendo was at the absolute peak of its reign over the video game industry, controlling 80% of the home console market. One in three American homes had a Nintendo console. So when Nintendo released a new game in this era, everyone noticed. And, according to Tilden, this was exactly Nintendo of America President <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Minoru_Arakawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minoru Arakawa’s</a> strategy: for everyone to be playing the game at the same time, talking about it on the playground, and spreading the hype. For this reason, even if you didn’t have an NES or have <em>SMB3</em>, you probably played it at a friend’s house or heard folks talking about it at school. And if not that, then you probably heard a commercial or caught a glimpse of the TV show or saw a kid wearing a T-shirt. Perfect storm.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine another game ever achieving this same exact combination of nostalgia triggers, but I suppose it could happen. In general, I think game and toy nostalgia for today’s youth is going to feel different from ours, because they’ve grown up with the internet where they have their own niches—there are far more playgrounds for them to talk on now.</p>
<p><em><b>It was so meaningful to me, as someone who’s dressed up as Link from the  </b></em><b>Zelda</b><em><b> series for Halloween at 12, 20, and 28, to read about your experiences of the game through a queer and female lens. I felt a deep sense of dread as I read about your performance at holidays, as you opened presents meant for who your relatives all thought you should be, not who you actually were (why can’t we just listen to our children?), though your own patient parents felt like a thrilling victory. But, and I apologize here for this bit of a tangent, while one could argue that  </b></em><b>SMB3</b><em><b> is in many ways for anyone, it still has the princess as not only locked up and unattainable, but as part of a mysterious chase. Which is to say, it’s incredible that you found yourself in that game, but I feel like that discovery was partially out of your own wonderful imagination. Could you talk about how your imagination had to realign what you were given to fit your needs as a kid, without queer or even female representation there for you? </b></em></p>
<p>I’m always amazed at the creative ways that girls and queer people can imaginatively locate ourselves in male-dominated, heteronormative, and cisnormative narratives. It’s why subtext and camp are such significant elements of queer culture. And <em>SMB3</em> fits perfectly with this campiness—it’s full of performative elements like all the costumes, the theatre curtain that lifts up at the beginning of the game, the “off-stage” area at the end of every level, etc. <a href="https://kotaku.com/miyamoto-confirms-that-super-mario-bros-3-was-a-play-1729805751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miyamoto himself has confirmed</a> that all of <em>SMB3</em>’s characters are just actors in a play. This was a lot of fun for me to think about in terms of Butler’s theory of gender performativity, and the ways I have performed or failed to perform my assigned gender throughout my life. After all, when I was a girl, dresses felt like as much of a costume for me as Mario’s Tanooki suit.</p>
<p>So as a kid, I definitely had some of those negative experiences of feeling forced to perform a gender role that was constraining to me—including, like you mentioned, my big fake smile whenever I received a Barbie at Christmas. But what was important for me about <em>SMB3</em> was that it was a “safe” environment where I could perform my homosexuality by chasing/desiring the princess. I had this limitless free space in which to explore. And while I felt most connected to Mario, the princess-rescuing hero, I also related, subconsciously, to Bowser’s monstrosity and to the princess’s trapped status. So when me-as-Mario would defeat me-as-Bowser-the-monster, it was, on some level like I was overcoming my shame about being some kind of unnatural creature. And when me-as-Mario rescued me-as-trapped-princess, it was like I was overcoming the ways that society had “damseled” me and prescribed me gender roles that didn’t felt like they fit.</p>
<p>So I inhabited these self-generated, imaginary narratives in <em>SMB3</em>, with me as the hero, but I did this in other kinds of play, too—I was always Simba and not Nala, Robin Hood and not Maid Marian. And while I would have loved to have had Rey or the girl Ghostbusters growing up, I don’t regret that I didn’t, because it fine-tuned my imagination in ways I’m really grateful for. Until we get better gender representation in games, at least we have folks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-11-father-mods-donkey-kong-so-his-daughter-can-play-as-pauline-rescuing-mario" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this dude</a> who will hack into the code and make the changes themselves.</p>
<p><em><b>What was your favorite thing you learned in doing this deep dive of research for this book? Was there anything you learned that you couldn’t quite fit into the book?</b></em></p>
<p>My favorite discoveries all revolved around hardware, since this was the element I knew the least about as I began my research process and this was the info I found most difficult to dig up. What’s so special about <em>SMB3</em> is that it debuted late in the NES console’s life, so the developers really had to get creative and milk the console for all that it could do. This resulted in cutting-edge new features like screen-splitting (for the <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/super-mario-bros-3/screenshots/gameShotId,31691/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status bar</a> at the bottom of the screen), diagonal scrolling (for those maddening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6B_ARho00o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sky levels</a> in World 5), parallax scrolling (for the 3D effect that lets you drop behind the screen when you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owRYdqX4twM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crouch on a white block</a>), and animated tiles (for the moving question marks on blocks or the zooming card strips in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyiMXbKgeZk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spade Panel mini-game</a>). Even Kondo got super creative with the hardware, using a certain sound channel in a really clever way to get it to produce more complex drum sounds. If you want to know what makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd78OMGLkVA&amp;list=PL6B16BD8C36B02A5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SMB3’s soundtrack</a> so special, it’s all in the drums.</p>
<p>I found especially meaningful the fact that the game designers and software engineers saw the technical constraints of the era as a fun challenge rather than a frustrating limitation. In much the same way that a poet like me gets a kick out of the tight constraints of the sonnet form, <em>SMB3</em>’s team often found that working with such a tiny amount of memory (the Word Document I’m typing this in is five times the size of the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. file) often led to especially creative solutions. They truly loved the challenge and saw it as a way to show off their skills.</p>
<p>I did end up with a lot of extra material—my final draft probably incorporated about a third of all the fascinating research I found. This is fairly typical of my writing process—I like to write long and cut. I found way more scholarship on gender, sexuality, and gaming than I was able to use, and on the history of Mario as a character and Nintendo mascot. I also had to cut a playthrough of <em>SMB3</em> in which I taught my wife Kate how to play the game, which was really funny because she didn’t grow up with video games and enjoys teasing me about my obsession with Mario. I couldn’t put her playthrough anywhere in the book, but I loved doing it and have some very special memories from that experience.</p>
<p>Finally, I found a ton of super fun images, GIFs, trivia, and tips and tricks that just couldn’t fit anywhere into the book, so I put all of it up on <a href="https://supermariobrothers3.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Tumblr</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em><b>I know, as someone who has read all your books, that you are also a poet! What else are you writing right now that we can look forward to? Do you plan to work on anything video game or pop culture related (like  </b></em><b>Mega City Redux)</b><em><b> soon? </b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for asking! I’m currently at work on two very different projects—the first is an opera libretto about the life of Christine de Pizan, the world’s first professional woman writer. After she was widowed at 25, Christine took up her pen in order to provide for her mother and three children. She became hotly engaged in debates with misogynist writers, writing long defenses of women that ultimately culminated in her 1405 allegory </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The City of Ladies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which she dreamed up a world where women can live safe from sexism and gendered violence. In my book of poems </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mega-City Redux</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I imagine taking a roadtrip with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Xena Warrior Princess, and Dana Scully to search for the modern-day version of the city. What I’ve discovered after publishing that book, however, is that I’m still very much fascinated by Christine, and I want to share the story of her life and work with others. I’m writing the libretto by collaging together her original writings (in Middle French) and translating the resulting collage into modern French.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also working on a project called “Wolf Tours” that blends fiction and poetry to comment on eco-tourism, cultural appropriation, and depression. It’s a series of poems in the voice of a pack of wolves that runs a touring company. I’m having a lot of fun imagining what these wolves would sell in their gift shop, or how they would write a magazine ad for their company (poorly, it turns out).</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month, I was going to write about <em>Albert Odyssey, </em>a 1997 RPG for the Sega Saturn. It was the first game I requested—the first game I asked for after seeing an ad in a magazine for it when I was in sixth grade, and the first RPG my dad and I played together. It was the initial adventure that set us on course to navigate lots of dungeons together, share strange worlds, and absorb lots of narratives and memories along the way. This is my last <em>Save Point, </em>so I wanted to reflect on my first RPG as a kind of bookend, an honoring of endings and beginnings.</p>
<p>I’m thinking instead about <em>Final Fantasy X, </em>which does this in a different way. The first thing I wrote for <em>Cartridge Lit </em>was an essay on<em> FFX</em>. It’s in my top three favorite games, so I always feel like I have more to say about it. I’ve considered it plenty through a personal lens. This month, I’m contemplating it on a larger scale.</p>
<p>I’m wondering to what extent games can prepare us for crises—for crossroads with stakes that stretch beyond ourselves. I remember learning in middle school that Ulysses S. Grant wanted to be a math teacher before the Civil War started, and being really surprised by that, being really startled by it. I think this is because it made me realize that we all have multiple potential paths within us, and which one unfolds isn’t just up to us. We’re swayed and shaped and sometimes pushed by politics and global affairs and sometimes armed conflict. That sometimes our path is chosen for us. Later in life, I talked to a woman on a plane who said she wanted to write fantasy novels, but that she was studying political science instead because she thought she could do more tangible good that way. She said she couldn’t turn away from the problems of the world, and that she wanted to make a direct impact. Similarly, I met another woman who said she wanted to be a yoga teacher, but that she was studying environmental law instead. Obviously, there are lots of different ways to make a positive impact on the world. There are lots of ways to do good, big and small. Cultural and legislative. Publicly recognized and private and unsung. I don’t want to draw a false dichotomy here. What’s interesting to me is this moment when people see something they can’t tolerate and that overrides certain other paths. This moment when they feel called to something.</p>
<p>We see this in games all the time, and the games often make it look easy. Thoughtless, really. Those involved are just involved—there’s no deliberation. In <em>Final Fantasy X, </em>we don’t get to see Yuna, one of the main characters, make her decision to become a Summoner—in other words, to take up the power necessary to fight against an oncoming evil named Sin. When we meet her, she has already become a Summoner. Her father was a Summoner before her, and we don’t get to know if she grappled with the decision to follow in his footsteps or whether she always assumed this is what she would do. Yuna isn’t the narrator of this story, so though we see her struggle with the burdens that come along with the path she has chosen, we never know exactly how she arrived at it or what sparked her conviction. It’s a sad path at times, and a hard path. But she knows she can’t turn away from people’s homes being destroyed, from lives being senselessly lost.</p>
<p>I’m interested in this idea of what we would do if the world were a utopia versus what we choose to do in the flawed world we have. Games sometimes touch on this. After the big conflict is over, after the final battle is won, in the end credits, sometimes we see some kind of montage revealing what the cast of heroes does in utopian peacetime. Sometimes they get married, have children, become teachers, run businesses, travel, create inventions, make art, go back to school, or retreat from society in cabins in the woods. It’s framed as, “Now that the conflict is over, they can be their utopian selves.” But the world we have doesn’t work like this. There is never an end to the conflict. There is never a shortage of things we might do to try to make things a little less awful for somebody somewhere, even just one person. So sometimes, that reality numbs people. Makes them throw their hands up. And sometimes it makes them commit to a path where they can engage with what they see wrong. Again, these things aren’t easy dichotomies. Lots of people do both. Our stats aren’t set.</p>
<p>Because <em>FFX </em>is among my favorite games—because it’s been with me since such a formative age—I find myself looking at the world we have and asking, self-consciously, but also sincerely, “What would Yuna do?” Because our world isn’t tidy. It’s not so simple as, “Go into the cloister and prove yourself and then defeat the thing that everyone agrees is a problem. Use force and win and that’s it.” A group of plucky misfits can do a lot, but they can’t single-handedly save the world in a way that invites immediate utopia for everyone everywhere. And so many games wrap up on this plot point, and maybe that’s part of what makes them so appealing, but also what prospectively limits them. Given the flawed and complicated and red-tape-filled and often corrupt and bitterly divided world we have, what would Yuna do? How would she apply her good intentions? What path would she choose, were she not all-powerful? Were she just a regular citizen, one of billions?</p>
<p>I don’t say this to condemn games. Or epic narratives. Or hero stories. I think they help us dream and articulate our ideals. Dr. Rudine Simms Bishop famously states that stories—particularly books, but all kinds of stories—can be both windows and mirrors. They show us ourselves and show us each other. They show a version of the world. What we do next with that information is not prescribed; it is left up to us. Stories help open up questions.</p>
<p>Games aren’t always stories, but my favorites are. The ones I’ve written about here, in this column, for the past year and a half, mostly are. Maybe part of what I like so much about these games is, in fact, that they force me to face these questions. To ask, “What would your heroes make of our world, and what does that mean for how you should act?” A mirror and a window.</p>
<p>I started out in political science my first year of college and ended up in literature and creative writing. A direct inversion of the woman I spoke to on the plane. I hope that this is (and was) the right thing to do. That this is a meaningful path. I do believe writing has incredible power—the power to help spread ideas. Ideas are what motivate and justify actions, or help call them into question. The world we have is built on ideas. They shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Yuna would do if she were here, and I hope that even if in just some tiny way, I can help make the world better, through teaching, through writing, through small interactions in the day-to-day. I do think these stories we love so much prompt us not to be complacent—to keep asking what we would do if we could make a difference. Because in the end, we can.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have this idea that everyone wants to make art. I take a lot of Lyft rides, and when I tell drivers I teach creative writing in addition to composition and literature—I’m often requesting transportation to and from campus, and in those cases, my job comes up in conversation right away—they almost invariably share what artistic practices they pursued when they were younger and wish they had more chances to pursue now. Sometimes they tell me they still make art of some kind. Music. Dance. Writing. Painting. But normally, it’s a story of how they played a certain instrument or excelled in a certain class when they were kids, but now the machinery of adult life keeps them bogged down with obligations, that there’s no energy left at the end of the day. These practices are so easily lost in the cracks. People tell me this with wistfulness and bitterness, with yearning and nostalgia. It’s a lot of people—the majority. It’s something I’ve observed over years.</p>
<p>I was privileged to grow up in a family where art was valued dearly. My parents met in theater and ran a puppet show company when I was small. In between working full-time jobs, they stitched felt costumes, scribbled out stories, and memorized songs. Even when money was tight for him, my grandfather took me to museums and asked me my thoughts on sculptures and paintings. My afternoons with him were filled with VHS musicals borrowed from the library, during which he’d well up unselfconsciously and murmur, “Listen. Isn’t that beautiful?” While cooking dinner, he’d sing showtunes. He’d pretend to play trombones and trumpets.</p>
<p>On the national level, it’s another story. Art is much less of a priority, at least financially. Making up just a fraction of a percent of the national budget, the NEA is inundated with grant applications from individuals and organizations every year. Hundreds of hopefuls seeking support for their next big program or project. The same is true of state commissions and private foundations dedicated to the arts. I know—I’ve written a lot of these proposals. Some I’ve written in pursuit of my own creative goals. But the bulk were on behalf of a nonprofit I worked for a few years ago. To make the strongest possible case in each application, I poured hours of research into the benefits of arts education (interestingly, there is little research on the arts’ positive impact on adult lives). My findings confirmed what I’d long suspected: that inclusion of the arts in K-12 curricula increases school attendance and enjoyment, that it correlates with higher grades, that it is linked with long-term civic engagement…the list goes on. Firsthand, I’ve seen the arts benefit children, adolescents, and yes, adults in powerful, far-reaching ways. So qualitatively and quantitatively, art enriches our lives. And most people I know and most strangers I meet harbor creative ambitions. So why is this impulse, individually and collectively, so frequently shoved to the side?</p>
<p>Well, art can be expensive. It can require supplies and submission fees and entry fees and space rental and travel and promotion and more. Early on, it can require exposure and nurturance or curiosity and fierce determination—I’m continually amazed by my friends who grew up being told art was a waste of money and effort and still relentlessly pursue it anyway. Certainly, depending on a person’s goals, it can require navigating gatekeeping people, settings, and expectations ranging from exhausting to downright toxic. These are all true. These are all important factors. But the one I want to focus on here is time.</p>
<p>A 2015 study from the NEA found that time was the #1 factor limiting adults’ attendance of arts-centered events. More than cost, more than local access. It was time. Granted, this is for attendance. But I suspect the same might be true of creation as well. You look at these charts of famous artists’ daily schedules and you notice that not a lot of them had 9-to-5s. Recently I was asked to be on a panel of judges for a grant application, and time came up over and over again. People asked for supplies. They asked for fee coverage. But more than anything, they asked for breathing room that would allow them to create. Time off from work. A month’s living expenses. These are common asks, and for good reason. Art takes time to dream up and create.</p>
<p>This is true for me too. I teach five classes a semester, and during the school year, I feel very much in “teacher mode.” I’ve grown away from the idea that artists only create when inspiration strikes—I think of creativity more like a muscle now. Something you can strengthen over time, yes, but regardless, a part of you that isn’t going anywhere. Nevertheless, while I like teaching a lot, I find it hard to switch into “writer mode” while doing a good job on grading, lesson planning, and committee work. It feels like turning an enormous ship. Like that artistic mindset takes breathing room to settle into, and that work is a quick jog, requiring fast thinking, adaptability, and self-discipline. The poems, especially, I’ve tried to write during the school year don’t feel as successful as those I write during summer, when I can slow my pace a little.</p>
<p>So how does all of this relate to a video game? Earlier this year I played <em>Earthlock, </em>a crowdfunded RPG from the Norwegian company Snowcastle. Like some <em>Final Fantasy </em>games, your characters can switch roles (sometimes called “jobs”) and gain different abilities based on these roles. Importantly, they also lose certain abilities based on which role they’re in. Unlike <em>FFV </em>and <em>FFX-2</em>, though, where all playable characters can move freely between roles as they are acquired through play—any character can become a Red Mage, for instance, or any character can become a Knight as long as you’ve gained access to those jobs—in <em>Earthlock, </em>each character comes with two roles uniquely assigned to them, and these never change. So Amon can be a Scout or a Blaster; he can never be a Warrior or a Veteran like Olia, who can never be a Focus or a Pestle like Gnart, and so on. Each role is useful and even essential given the strategy needed for each battle. This presents an interesting challenge, and I liked <em>Earthlock </em>overall. But it frustrated me that I couldn’t have access to all my characters’ cool skills at the same time, and what irked me even more was that changing between roles, or Stances, takes an entire turn. The transition was painfully slow.</p>
<p>This felt relatable. This idea that we can all do certain things—unique things—but that switching between those modes or roles can be a gradual process. A process that requires our patience, that we can’t necessarily speed up. That it’s true, that I’m not just imagining it when the structured mindset of lesson planning feels different from the intuitive, emotional one I occupy when I write poems, and that it’s difficult to whip back and forth between them within the same hour. Yet, right before we all went our separate ways for summer, I told some friends in my department, “I’ve been telling myself this story that I can either be a teacher or a writer but not both at the same time. I have to rewrite that somehow. I have to tell myself a new story.” I have to do this because I want writing and teaching to coexist more harmoniously. I have to do this because if both are muscles, I don’t want to let either lie dormant for months.</p>
<p>I don’t have easy answers for this. I think this is part of the sweeping dilemma, the reason so many strangers I meet want to make art but rarely do. The transitions from employee to family member to artist to whatever can take adjustment, can take time. And time is something we are all short on, for innumerable reasons. This isn’t always something we can just will ourselves out of; we live in a culture that encourages workaholism and sometimes demands it for survival. We live in a world where countless factors, some chosen and some not, come between us and boundless creation. There’s a reason creativity crowns the mountain of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. But no model is perfect, and I’ve heard arguments against that way of thinking about art. That we need to tell a new story together, that Artist is a role we can switch into like Chef when we’re making a meal. I don’t have to navel-gaze about doing this—I just make food because I have to. I don’t see it as a role change. And maybe, with practice, I can do this with art. Make it a natural extension of life, not something separate and demanding.</p>
<p>I don’t have easy answers. I know this is hard. I also know these practices light a lot of us up, and I hope we can find ways to claim them in whatever ways we can. Quickly, slowly, or otherwise.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In  </em>Night in the Woods<em>, you play twenty-year-old Mae Borowski upon moving back to a hometown in decline. Her parents want to know why she just dropped out of college, her friends have all gotten jobs, her dreams keep getting weirder, and she believes there&#8217;s a mysterious threat lurking in the woods. </em>NITW<em> has won the BAFTA Game Award for Narrative and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the Independent Games Festival, among other accolades.</em></p>
<p><em>Scott Benson is the co-creator of  </em>Night in the Woods<em>. Below, Scott talks with </em>Cartridge<em> editor William Hoffacker about gothic horror, researching town histories, how Twitter helped him write dialogue, and more.</em></p>
<p><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b> begins with white text on a black background, with language and lineation evocative of poetry. Some lines are chosen by the player out of a few options, and some lines that follow reflect those choices. Although selecting words turns out to be a fundamental mechanic in the game, this prologue stands apart from the rest, as nothing else in the game looks quite like it.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>What is the intended purpose that necessitates this opening? What expectations is it meant to create? Why not just drop the player immediately into the first scene at the bus station?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mini interactive fiction bit at the start was sort of a statement of purpose, setting the tone of the game. We were about to put you right into the bus station with Mae, and things are colorful and funny and you’re learning to jump and run around for a while. But the game has other things on its mind, and we wanted to say up front, “Hey, this game has some preoccupations and context, let’s start thinking about that right from the jump.” The intro bit also gets across a lot of info in a very short amount of time, too. We wanted to give people a sense of where they were about to go, and who these people are, and what their context is. It feels out of place almost the first time you play the game, but I think eventually it fits right in as you get deeper into it, and especially if you do the recommended second playthrough. I’d say the game catches up to the info right around where Mae and Bea go the library and you start getting a lot of information about the town, and the themes of the game, which have been building through the first half, start emerging and interlocking in a way that matches up with that intro. That was the idea at least! Also it’s fun seeing Mae being all articulate and poetic, which she certainly is not for much of the game.</span></p>
<p><em><b>What sorts of literature do you most enjoy reading? What books (or other texts) had the most profound influence on the writing of  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two parts of the answer here—the literary influences and the research. Bethany did a whole lot of research for the history of Possum Springs. The game is based a lot on where she grew up, and she dove into old books detailing the ups and downs and struggles of towns like hers and Possum Springs. The history of labor struggle and exploitation, the out and out wars fought against bosses and police by workers, and the atrocities committed on entire towns by capital and the state, is often … well, suppressed maybe? We don’t learn a lot about it. But it’s there, and it’s not that long ago, and we still deal with these conditions today. Bethany is now practically an amateur historian of this kind of thing, and a lot of the details of the town’s past are pulled very much from real life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as my end of things goes, I tend to read a lot of short story collections. I’ve been a pretty voracious reader all my life and I’m not sure why I have such a hard time getting through longer texts these days. Probably the untreated ADHD thing or something. So I take in a lot of shorter works, mostly horror or something lurid, folklore, and some general gothic lit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flannery O’Connor is an ever-present influence in the brand of gothic the game trades in. Her ability to explore the horrors lurking in southern Americana while suffusing the entire thing in this overarching, terrifying presence of grace, is an inspiration. I was a Christian for much of my life, was even in ministry, but lost my faith completely. But I connect with O’Connor’s “Christ-haunted” world. God is utterly gone for me, but the moments of grace remain in a beautiful naturally-occurring way, and exploring faith as a purely human phenomenon without anyone on the other end of the phone, so to speak, is interesting to me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Good Man Is Hard To Find</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wise Blood</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were definite indirect influences in that arena, though O’Connor and I would disagree on the ultimate truth of God’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some weird fiction and cosmic horror makes it into the game as well, and it’s tough to get out from under the shadow of Lovecraft there. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Beyond</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a pretty direct influence on one pivotal scene. And we of course had our own plans for Lovecraft’s reactionary, racist, nationalist bullshit that pop up later on in the game. We do kind of a humanist, leftist cosmic horror, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d also shout out a little known weird fiction story called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dead Valley</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Ralph Adams Cram. It’s one of the best “something weird is going on out there in the woods” stories ever.</span></p>
<p><b>Night in the Woods </b><em><b>frequently gives the player the opportunity to choose what the player-character, Mae, will say next. Such choices feel consequential, yet Mae is not some blank slate of a protagonist. She is an individual with a distinct, recognizable personality.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>So how did you strike that balance? What did you do to ensure that Mae would seem consistently herself while still giving the player a real sense of agency in directing her conversations?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t interested in empowering the player to roleplay. Alec and I decided from the start that this was Mae’s story, and she was her own person, and not a shell for the player. I really love exploration in games, and I think it’s maybe one of the best things you can do in a game both as a player and a designer. So navigating Mae’s life and navigating the dialogue is a type of exploration, just as running and jumping around the world is exploration. We were big on branching dialogue that felt organic and went on tangents, and were very anti Big Moral Choice moments. If anything we wanted to undercut any sense of the player being able to game her dialogue or character. This isn’t a game about making the Mae you want. It’s about exploring the Mae that is, and the world she lives in.</span></p>
<p><em><b>If you could adapt any literary work into a video game (of any type, any scale), what work would you choose, and what might that game look and play like?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d love to see a good atmospheric horror post-point-and-click adventure game based on the Silver John stories by Manly Wade Wellman. Appalachian weird fiction. It’s dynamite and criminally unknown. The combo of easygoing wandering occult expert John The Balladeer and the devils lurking in various hollers is just so pleasing. Maybe just pick a handful of stories from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Fears The Devil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and run with it? And do it right. Actually wait don’t do this, I want to someday. I got dibs.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2649" src="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2.jpg 1920w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cartridgelit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NITW2-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a></p>
<p><em><b>I assume that while you were writing dialogue for  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>, you knew that the game wouldn’t have voice acting, and instead the text would appear inside speech bubbles above the characters’ heads. Though the speech bubbles vary in size and shape, they never occupy a whole lot of real estate on screen.</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>How much of a challenge was it to write all dialogue knowing it would be read within those confines? How did spatial limitations alter the content and/or the process of your writing?</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on Alec and I knew we didn’t want to just do like a dialogue box at the bottom of the screen or something, and I sketched up some ideas of these fun little word bubbles and Alec implemented all of these expressive systems for making them wobble and boil, and animating the text and so forth. Writing for them became second nature very quickly, in part because I basically wrote everything in tweet length. I do a lot of twittering and it’s a platform that is underrated as far as style goes. You sort of learn how to segment longer thoughts, add pauses and single word tweets for humor and tension, all that kind of stuff. Twitter culture itself wasn’t a big influence on the dialogue, but the way Twitter trains you to work within strict character limits definitely was. So in the game we just learned to use that to our advantage. Also there’s nothing worse that opening up a conversation in-game and it’s just like paragraphs of unbroken text on screen. Chopping it up into smaller bits let us play with rhythm and pauses and personality and so forth. Also I think it feels better to click through a strategically segmented and timed series of bits than get hit with one big slab of dialogue.</span></p>
<p><em><b>If someone played  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b> and loved the experience so much that they just wanted more, more, more, what would you recommend they do next? (Recommendations might include other video games, but please feel free to answer however you like: books, movies, music, any activity, etc.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>. It’s a very clear influence on NITW. Seriously, drop what you’re doing and go play it. We owe a lot to that game. Similarly, <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em> has some DNA we swiped for our game. God, that game is a rare gem.</span></p>
<p><em><b>As large as religion looms over  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><em><b>, it wasn’t until my second playthrough that I noticed sun-shapes where I’d expect to see crosses. I realized that Christianity apparently doesn’t exist in this world because none of our cultural touchstones do. The characters speak of holidays different from ours. Saints and myths are recalled, but none we would recognize from history. Wars are invoked, but never by name. Even the constellations are invented. Also, the movies at the video store are made up (though  </b></em><b>The Shape of Water </b><em><b>seems derivative of  </b></em><b>Swamp Husband</b><em><b>), and I can’t recall any allusions to real-world celebrities (unless the Chris Evans run over by Mallard is </b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>that</b></span><b> Chris Evans).</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>Why was it important to you that the game’s world be cut from whole cloth? How was your experience of originating so much at the cost of relying on established reference points—difficult, fun, both, something else?</b></em></p>
<p><em><b>(Side-note: Writing this question brought to mind another game with anthropomorphic animals:  </b></em><b>Star Fox 64</b><em><b>. If the player shoots teammate Falco, he may respond, “Hey Einstein, I’m on your side,” which begs the question of why he uses the name Einstein in the same pejorative way that we do. One might ask, “Is their universe actually ours in the distant future? Do they have their own brilliant Einstein by coincidence?” Did you design  </b></em><b>Night in the Woods</b><b> </b><em><b>to try to circumvent this sort of line of questioning?)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a pretty strict No Memes/No Reference Humor policy but we played the relationship to real world culture pretty loose. There are a very small handful of visual references and we mention like Shakespeare and a few other things from IRL culture here and there, but otherwise we wanted the world to exist on its own without propping ourselves up on some HEY REMEMBER THIS stuff. Like it’s fine to acknowledge or shout something out but we’ve had decades now of humor and culture that leans heavily on reference, and videogames are just rife with it. I think the Lovecraft material is the most blatant cultural riff in the game but that was because messing with cosmic horror stuff and his legacy in particular was a small part of what we were doing in the background. It was important for us to do as much as we could to create things that could stand on their own without having to fall back on reminding the player that they like <em>Star Wars</em> or whatever. A really clumsy overt reference in a work of fiction can throw me right out of it. And it’s just more fun and more interesting to create cultural touchstones that originate from and exist within the world you’re creating. It’s just a more satisfying way of doing things, and it feels more honest for lack of better words. That’s very much a your-mileage-may-vary thing but that’s where we came down on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as far as the religious symbology you mentioned, the church symbol in particular is part of a larger visual theme all over the place in the game, in a way a standard crucifix could never be.</span></p>
<p><em><b>What new games are you most anticipating right now? (Answers might include not only upcoming releases but also games already out that you haven’t gotten to play yet.)</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m really looking forward to the final episode of <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> which I believe drops this year. I played <em>The Witcher 3</em> for the first time earlier this year and was blown away by it, so I’m looking forward to the studio’s next game <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Whenever that comes out. <em>Ooblets</em> is looking really cool, and <em>Wandersong</em> seems like it’s gonna be some cheerful fun. Uh … <em>Dead Static Drive</em> looks super rad, as does <em>Knights And Bikes</em>. I’m probably forgetting something. Oh right I think there’s a <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel out there somewhere. I’m a pretty big Souls games fan and I think the overall series could use a bit of a break but I’d definitely show up for a decent <em>Bloodborne</em> sequel.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I wanted to add some new art to my home. In looking over the many images I gathered as prospects, my husband observed, “Everything you Pinned is a magical woman.” He was right. There were women with swords and women with spears. Women with lances and women with shields. Women whose hands glowed with spells and women who wore crowns made of stars. It was an unintentional but admittedly sprawling gallery of magical women. Specifically, magical warrior women. I want to interrogate this.</p>
<p>Where did this fascination start? With myth, probably. Diana. The huntress, the moon goddess, with her bow and arrow and stag. My mother read myths to me as a kid. Probably, the grain of this obsession lies there. I was always drawn to this kind of imagery. This imagery and this archetype.</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1990s. The “girl power” era. There was Sailor Moon. There was Xena. Buffy. Captain Janeway. The Spice Girls. I felt semi-surrounded by representations of powerful/warrior/magical women. Even if some of those reflections sent mixed messages, they provided a kind of aspirational mirror. I guess we would call them role models. Characters who modeled certain roles. Of leaders, of fighters, of heroes.</p>
<p>On the gaming front, there was Seung Mina. I adored her from the first time my ten-year-old hands arranged themselves on the wobbly joystick and smooth, indented buttons of the <em>Soul Edge </em>(a.k.a. <em>Soul Blade</em>) arcade game. I loved Sophitia, too, with her broadsword and shield. Her laced boots that reminded me of Diana. But I was better with Seung Mina—her slashing range weapon—and I loved her long braid, her athleticism. Her movements that were somehow both graceful and ferocious. Her confidence—that smile when she won a match.</p>
<p>A 2016 report from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media and the J. Walter Thompson Company found that out of 4,300 women in nine countries—Brazil, China, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Russia, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—90% said that female role models in forms of pop culture like TV and film were important. 90%.</p>
<p>My father and I would go to the arcade, and I would save <em>Soul Edge </em>for last. This is because I was determined to beat it. I knew from the Character Select screen there were only so many characters to fight your way through before something different had to happen. This line of thought helped me persuade my father to contribute a few more quarters to my cause (though, to be fair, he didn’t need much coaxing). I got better each weekend. I learned Seung Mina’s combos. Gauged the alacrity of different opponents, the exact height of Seung Mina’s jumps. The coordination necessary to bounce back from a fall. I learned to see openings and take them.</p>
<p>Finally, one day, I made it to Cervantes, the ghostly pirate, a non-playable character. Thus, the presumed final boss. For several weeks, he finished me off. Each time Dad and I left the arcade, I had to start back from the beginning. Had to fight my way back to the shifting, tilting port with its ominous, carved Jolly Roger. “This is it,” I would say to my father. “It has to be.” Cervantes was muscular. Hulking and aggressive. I had to learn to be fearless. To not be afraid of his glowing, chilling eyes or his twin swords that swirled around his head, manipulated through telekinesis. His scowl or his gloating when I fell. I had to learn to get back up.</p>
<p>In the study, 61% of the women surveyed said female role models in pop culture have been “influential in their lives.” 58% said they made them “more ambitious or assertive.” In the U.S., 1 in 9 even said these kinds of representatives helped them leave abusive relationships. In Brazil, it was 1 in 4. This means something. These are more than “feel good” statistics. These are real lives changed. By stories. By mythic women.</p>
<p>So this <em>matters, </em>somehow. It matters that in playing a young woman with a halberd, I learned something about courage. It matters that my tiny, ten-year-old hands took on a murderous pirate. It matters that when Seung Mina and I defeated Cervantes, and when he wasn’t the final boss, and when his body caught flame and turned into something else—a demon, a blazing skeleton, an evil energy named Soul Edge—I didn’t back down, even though I was grossed out and a little afraid of his fiery skull. That I glared back and charged right at him.</p>
<p>It matters in the sense that games are simulations—safe places to explore what you could or might do. To experience vicarious power. Even though <em>Soul Edge </em>was a fighting game, it was also arguably a role-playing game. Something more interactive, at least in one sense, than a role model merely watched onscreen. The gaming medium offers an attempt, if just a small one—a subjective audition for the role itself.</p>
<p>It matters, somehow, that these characters sunk in. Such that still, to this day, I surround myself with magical warrior women.</p>
<p>I mentioned mixed messages. And in returning to Seung Mina and sort of “close reading” her as research for writing this, I was surprised at how sexualized she is in official and fan art alike. Did I notice her bare thighs and exposed midriff when I played the game as a kid? I’m sure this wasn’t lost on me. I’m sure I noticed. But I was too enamored with her warrior status to let it dissuade me much. Her status as a young woman taking on enemies bigger and stronger than her. I latched onto that despite, perhaps, some subtle inkling in my ten-year-old brain that maybe I was not the intended audience, the player they had in mind. As an adult, it felt strange to scroll through Google images and see rendering after rendering of this childhood hero in suggestive poses and shrunken attire. A little unsettling, like maybe I am foolish. That some interpretations, while maybe not <em>wrong, </em>are pushing against a tide. I see empowering. You see sex. An object—just an image.</p>
<p>In literary studies, there’s one branch of thought called reader-response theory that says that texts and characters don’t have single, fixed meanings. That we decide the meaning, we assign the meaning. That meaning lies with us. In close reading Seung Mina, I think about her weapon and how in real life I panic killing bugs. Then grieve and feel guilty. How I’m fairly adverse to violence. When I was younger, surrounded by warrior women, I thought I wanted to learn martial arts. Thought I wanted to handle weapons. I took tae kwon do lessons. Took fencing lessons. Trying to be like these heroes in a literal, tangible way. In the end, though, my interests shifted, and I chose to study stories instead. The weapons, for me, became metaphors in a way that still left them appealing. A painting of a woman with a weapon signaled agency—it’s the image of the weapon I grew to like, not the actual weapon itself. Maybe someone else would interpret this archetype differently; that person might learn to swordfight. My younger self saw steel and wood; my older self, analogy. Is one of us wrong? Is there a right or wrong way to “read” a young woman with a spear?</p>
<p>Empowerment and role models are tricky things. Elusive and personal things. But 90% is not a small number, so there’s something vital in them. From Diana to Seung Mina to the artwork I Pinned, this archetype of the magical warrior woman is rattling around in me, resonating. Though it’s complex and messy, still we get to claim what the woman with the halberd means.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I am holding onto my pet for some sentimental reason. (For example, the pet belonged to a now deceased family member, the pet helped me through a hard time in my life, etc.) </em></p>
<p>This is one of the Yes or No questions, out of six pages of questions, on the checklist my husband and I methodically peruse, trying to decide whether it is time to dial up the veterinarian who will come into our home and put our terminally ill cat “to sleep.”</p>
<p>Later I read this question to my father over the phone and he balks. “Who would say no to that?” he asks. “Who could say no?” It’s a fair question.</p>
<p><em>The pet helped me through a hard time in my life, etc. </em></p>
<p>What do we really mean when we say, “et cetera”? The utterance lost at the end of the ellipses. What muscles in between hulking parentheses like a linebacker in a center airplane seat the moment our voice trails off. Sitting there and scowling. Wanting to be said.</p>
<p>This month I’m thinking about <em>Lunar, </em>an RPG made for the PlayStation in 1996. In it, you play Alex, a young man who sets out to rescue his friend after she is revealed to be a goddess and predictably, the evil forces of the world come and claim her, desiring her power. Along the way, you meet lots of new friends and face lots of new enemies. As with any RPG, sometimes you will “KO,” or get knocked out during battle when your HP reaches zero. In some games, this state is called “Unconscious.” In some, it’s simply called “Death.” <em>Lunar</em> calls it “Faint.” We can use different terms, but we mean the same thing—the enemy was too much and you failed to stay upright. “Failed to” or simply “couldn’t.” I guess there’s room for interpretation here. Even if the result is the same.</p>
<p>In every game I’ve played except <em>Lunar</em>, it’s on you to keep yourself and your party members upright. It’s on you to make sure you’re prepared to enter the dungeon, taking care that your armor has sufficient defense stats and your inventory of items is appropriately full. Depending on the stage of the game—and the amount of money you have—you can purchase herbs and tinctures and berries and potions that will restore a little, a medium amount, or a lot of HP, for use before you die/KO. Ideally, they will be all you need. But you can also purchase herbs and things that will revive you—bring you back from incapacitation. In this way, “KO” makes more sense than “Death” to me, in the terminology of games. You can’t bring people back from death. But rock bottom? A state of waking unconsciousness? Yeah. You can sometimes beckon people back from that.</p>
<p>In every other game, this is on you. You need to prepare. If you KO/die, it’s revive or game over. But in <em>Lunar</em>, Alex has a furry companion, Nall, who will sometimes bring him back. No one is sure what animal Nall is at the start of the game. He’s brown and black and white with feathery wings. People call him a cat, though he’s clearly not a cat. He’s not a playable character, but he has a lot of in-game dialogue. He’s a presence in your life. And in battle, every so often, when you KO and can’t or won’t revive yourself, he will swoop down beside your lifeless body, shake you a little, and say, <em>Come on! Get back on your feet! </em>Then, you’ll regain a little HP. You’ll come back from KO and get up.</p>
<p><em>The pet helped me through a hard time in my life, etc.</em></p>
<p>It’s 2012 and I live in a state where I don’t have friends yet. I’m coming out of a messy, painful breakup. Some months I struggle to pay my bills. My depression is so deep, some mornings, I don’t want to get out of bed. My limbs feel like they are full of pebbles. Like I am a pebble-filled woman. My phone alarm jingles and I stare at the ceiling and I stare at the ceiling and ask myself, <em>Why should I? </em>I hit snooze and roll over and stare at the wall. I do not revive myself.</p>
<p>But there’s a twitch at the door, and the creak of a board. The puff of black and white fur. The cat comes in and her eyes look at mine and she jumps on the bed and purrs. <em>Come on, </em>she purrs. <em>Get back on your feet. </em>It’s a sound I can’t resist. I sit up despite myself, a little restored. An HP or two is better than zero. It’s something better than zero.</p>
<p>This happened in lots of battles. This happened more than once. Sometimes you live for someone else during these rough patches, these stretching “et ceteras.” Someone who is all love and all need. You have to care for them and so you get up, leave the pebbles in bed for a while. You feed them and figure you might as well eat too. You shower. You care for them, and in doing so, you have to care for yourself.</p>
<p><em>If I were in a similar situation, I would not want to live. </em>Another survey question. I had to stop on this one. But it also helped me know.</p>
<p>Luna fell ill. Rapidly ill. Her decline was swift and shocking. I kept denying it at first, thinking, <em>Maybe we’ll get a few more weeks. </em>It wasn’t until I saw her stumble and wanted to scream, <em>Come on! Get back on your feet! </em>that I knew the answer to this question. <em>If I were in a similar situation—</em>pause. Ellipsis. Et cetera.</p>
<p>Near the end of the game you find out Nall is a dragon. In a flash, his hidden power is unlocked and he grows enormous, takes his true shape. He’s vibrant, shiny, the size of a school bus. You ride him through the skies.</p>
<p>Once, I dreamt that Luna grew enormous and I rode on her back to school. I clutched her dark fur and nestled into her warmth, her milky scent. It was such a joyful vision, I thought of it a lot. Luna, a titanic beast. So powerful nothing could touch her.</p>
<p>The night before the vet came to our home, I dreamt Luna had feathery wings. She was crouching in the closet, where she was in real life. But in the dream, she had these bright wings. Luna, the healer, the little dragon. Ready to take her next shape.</p>
<p>No one gets to tell us how to grieve. I won’t say I don’t think there are wrong ways to grieve, but I don’t think there are “right” ways either. We can scroll through our inventories all we want, but none of our items quite get at it. Lots of people think they know what transpires when we die. That something happens. Or it doesn’t. Some have a lot of conviction about this. I know what I think happens. But the truth of it is that no one knows for sure. So all we have, really, is hope.</p>
<p>I hope she took flight toward the sky, growing enormous as a school bus. I hope she shook off that cocoon of discomfort and licked her new fur clean. I named her Luna because I loved the moon and the way I saw it in the crescent on her belly, that archer’s bow of white. I hope she is up there drinking the moon, huge bowl of cream that it is. Chasing the stars like houseflies.</p>
<p>No one gets to know. But I hope this for us. That our “et ceteras” can span to infinity.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For better or worse, lots of us want to “have it all.” “It” may look different for each of us, but often, there are underlying themes. Caring relationships. Work we have a talent for and that we enjoy. Upward mobility. Security, fun, and comfort. Passion and a sense of purpose. The blueprints around which we build their lives are as many and varied as the brains that dream them up. But any time we want more than one thing, the question of how to have both the new and the old sneaks into play. The more things we want, the longer and wider our reach must become—long enough, wide enough to capture “it all.” The better jugglers we must become, too, since acquiring or establishing things is only half the battle. There’s the maintenance, too. The “having.”</p>
<p>I think this is part of what entices me so much about games, particularly RPGs. Assuming you fight enough, you’re guaranteed a steady income. You almost always have built-in best friends and romances, or at least mutual crushes. Your airship is a kind of home, a traveling hostel for your eccentric companions. In leveling up, you always progress. It is almost impossible to stop progressing. You’d have to play the game for a long time. You’re a hero, a leader, an expert in your field. In the midst of the drama of saving the world, you enjoy lots of pleasures parenthetically. You kind of have it all.</p>
<p>There’s one game I’ve played that takes this idea a little more literally. It’s called <em>Life Quest. </em>In this late-2000s PC game from Big Fish, you take on the role of a recent high school graduate who engages in contests with former peers to see who can achieve certain milestones first—things like getting a job, purchasing a vehicle, adopting a pet, and so on. The game frames these as “friendly rivalries.” It’s a tension presented as the gym buddy idea—if you hold me accountable and I hold you accountable, we’ll be more likely to meet our shared goals. But the contests can stress you out, too. This is part of games, part of why they work—they get under our skin. They make us compete. They make us want to win.</p>
<p>I played <em>Life Quest </em>during a gap year I took between undergrad and grad school. At that time, I was aimless. I’d applied for the Peace Corps and been rejected (thanks, weird dietary stuff). I’d prepared no backup plan. Eventually, I applied to grad school, which launched my career in higher ed. But in the interim, I treaded water, working a demoralizing retail job and wondering how all my friends made flourishing look so easy.</p>
<p>My then-boyfriend played lots of PC games, and I occasionally glanced over his shoulder. <em>Life Quest </em>wasn’t my usual style of game, but he encouraged me to create my own character, and I was quickly drawn in. It felt painfully relatable to my own situation, this series of “friendly rivalries.” In my waking life, I felt like everyone I knew was passing me by. In the game, at least I could eat at fancy restaurants and watch my avatar pull ahead on a literal racetrack that charts your advancement in contrast to the AI’s. Playing <em>Life Quest </em>was simultaneously masochistic and satisfying. It provided a simulated path out of my rut—a kind of vicarious hope. Just by clicking the “work” button repeatedly, I could accrue cash and increase my standing. Just by taking an acting class, I could boost my “charm” points and attract a compatible mate. Happiness, promotion, health, and esteem were all within my reach if I just managed my time and resources correctly. Life was just a puzzle to be solved. A game that was possible to win.</p>
<p>A while back I was up for a big opportunity I didn’t quite get. It was hard not to be disappointed. I had started dreaming about certain milestones I might check off an invisible bucket list I hadn’t known I possessed. <em>Spend a certain amount of money on home furnishings. Take your significant other out on a certain number of dates. </em>These are things the game encourages you to do. Requires you to do, in fact. <em>Life Quest</em>’s soundtrack echoed in my head as I pictured my avatar bursting through some eagerly beckoning, preprogrammed finish line. The compulsory spotlight beaming its conic ray on my smiling avatar. The shower of confetti and fanfare that signified victory raining down on her. Her/me, I should say.</p>
<p>The week I learned I hadn’t gotten the opportunity coincided with a trip out of town. Slipping into the bathtub of a hotel room distant from my daily life, I stared absently at the wallpaper and felt the rising steam from the water warm my skin. I contemplated this setback and what it meant for my wants in life. What it meant for “having it all” and my stretching reach that couldn’t quite hold it. And as <em>Lifetime </em>movie-ish as it may sound, this really happened: my eyes focused on the flower-speckled wallpaper and I realized the cursive letters scrawled like fading ink in its sepia backdrop were partial lines from a seventeenth-century poem by Robert Herrick, a poem that is all about relinquishing that desperate, hungry reach. “Gather ye rosebuds,” the wallpaper cautioned. Something about time. Something about death. The language and the steam interlaced.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,</em><br />
<em>Old Time is still a-flying;</em><br />
<em>And this same flower that smiles today</em><br />
<em>Tomorrow will be dying.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately for us, depending on your perspective, life doesn’t work like <em>Life Quest </em>might suggest. We aren’t locked into competing with our friends. We aren’t locked into one version of success. Our happiness doesn’t automatically rise with eating, nor does it immediately dwindle when we’re at work. It isn’t a gauge. It isn’t that simple. These days there’s a movement to “gamify” everything, and to some extent, I can get behind that. Life can be devastating. Life can be tedious. I see little harm in thinking in metaphors, in analogies, that lend some levity to one’s daily grind. But it seems important to remember that these things aren’t formulaic. And all games end the same way. All games end.</p>
<p>That time I played <em>Life Quest </em>in my wandering gap year, a glitch caused the screen to black out abruptly while I was dancing with my spouse in a club. No matter how many times I rebooted the game, that was it—I was dancing, then darkness descended. “I guess I died,” I laughed. “Right there in the club. I just die. That’s how my Life Quest ends.”</p>
<p>Reboot. Dance. Flicker. And darkness. That’s how my Life Quest ended.</p>
<p><em>Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.</em> The finish line approaches swiftly enough. There is no need for us to chase it.</p>
