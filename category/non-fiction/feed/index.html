								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 1999, I did my best to explain what an MMORPG
was to all of the adults in my life.
There weren’t many; recently expelled from the
ninth grade, the
circle was mostly
limited to my parents and my therapist. Even within that set, I only really
had to be thorough with my Dad, to explain
why I needed to put
the monthly access
fee on his
credit card.</p>



<p>“You
create this character,” I’d tell them,
“and then it puts them in this game world,
with all these other
people who have created their
own characters. And then, whatever. You can explore
this world and play whatever
type of character you want.”</p>



<p>In the web 1.0 days of adults’ moral panic around teenagers talking about sex in chat rooms, with anonymous strangers who were sure to abduct us (the only thing anyone could conceive we’d want to do online), one question inevitably came up: “What if the other people in the game are psychos?”</p>



<p>This had to be dealt
with carefully for
me, a 14-year-old with a dark sense
of humor who constantly got into
fights with other
kids and threatened them with worse.
I was often called a psycho
myself, and after all, here
I was playing <em>Ultima Online</em>.</p>



<p>In a way, my angsty offline lifestyle was the point. I played video games as a way of escaping into another identity, and few games in late 90’s offered as complete an escape as <em>Ultima Online</em>, known to its players as UO. It offered not just an identity for my own fantasy, but one to be observed by others, who would never know me as anyone else. I wanted people to see me as a grizzled adventurer with a devil-may-care disposition, like Wolverine, not a kid in an ugly school uniform with a principal-may-care disposition who would certainly die on a tour of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. Or any chocolate factory, for that matter.</p>



<p>What would be even harder to explain was that the thing I sought an escape from was the life my family had decided was best for me: the private school life. Prior to my expulsion, I was getting bussed out of the city to attend school with my alleged social betters in the suburbs, at great expense to my parents. This, they told me, was the way to a better life for me. A life, apparently, of strip malls and overpriced chain restaurants, in a culture that despised my closeted queerness and had a very, very tenuous relationship with my Jewishness. A life spent in drab, cookie cutter houses, whose doors were always deadbolted while their inhabitants peered suspiciously through the peephole at anyone who came around.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>One of the best un-talked-about aspects of video
games is their
general lack of soul-crushing suburban sprawl.
They don’t need
it. There’s not
even anywhere to put it.</p>



<p>Your basic medieval crypto-European city in a game
like <em>Ultima Online </em>is usually small enough to cross
it end-to-end within
about five minutes.
Of course, it doesn’t fulfill
the same matrix
of purposes that real
cities do. It requires no government, no school system,
and very little
in the way
of social services. It doesn’t need
outlets for recreation, because duh, the
game itself is the recreation.</p>



<p>And it definitely doesn’t need vast swathes of oversized single-family homes, sitting on former
farmland snatched up by greedy
developers. In a single-player game
like, say, <em>Skyrim</em>, any given city only needs one available housing unit, if that. But
what if the
game is an MMO that
wants to provide its player base with the ability
to build and furnish houses
for their characters? What the hell do you do
then, when your biggest city is <em>maybe </em>the size of an Ikea store?</p>



<p>As it happened, UO was the first game to answer this question. Especially in its early days, in-game achievements tended to be ethereal and fleeting. Whatever treasures you found on your adventures would only be yours until you were inevitably killed and your corpse looted by whoever happened to be around when you bit it. This made houses an extremely attractive concept. You could secure a house, and any chests or decorations inside, with unpickable locks. Whatever you put in your house was definitely <em>your shit</em>, which was never quite true for whatever you carried on your person.</p>



<p>Where to put these houses? UO’s solution was simple: since there was no room in the cities, they made the unsettled land outside them available instead. You had to buy a house deed from an NPC vendor in town, picking from about a dozen styles, then find a large enough patch of empty ground somewhere in the wilderness. Double-click the deed, target your chosen spot, and boom! You are now housed.</p>



<p>The problem was that, even with the entire country
of Brittannia available, there just wasn’t enough space. As soon as house
placement was enabled,
most of the game world
became one giant suburb. The bulk of the play-space that we were
paying ten 1999
dollars a month
for vanished. Instead of venturing through the
untamed countryside, with
no idea what
might lie on the horizon, we now found ourselves weaving through a vast, cookie
cutter house labyrinth.</p>



<p>The problem was scale. At its peak,
UO had around 250,000 active
subscribers; roughly the population of Buffalo, New York. To cross Buffalo
end-to-end, you’re in for a 10-mile hike,
3 ½ hours at a good
clip. Not only
is it a much longer
cross-town hoof than
any UO city,
it’s probably hundreds of times larger than the entire
country of Brittannia.</p>



<p>Even with all those players
divided between a couple dozen servers, there was enough demand
for
houses to render
them virtually priceless. San Francisco real
estate had nothing
on Brittannia. If you
were unwilling to pay real
world currency for
a house on eBay (probably because you were
at least a little
bit worried that
there might be a Hell),
you had to play UO basically as a full-time job, grinding out gold
for hours upon
hours every day,
in order to buy one.</p>



<p>Having a house
was one of the ultimate in-game achievements. You
had to be a dedicated player for years
before you even
had a shot at it.
The irony of this was
that, once you
had a house, there was almost
nothing to actually
do in it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>In 2009, ten years after my first existential battle with the hellscape of Midwestern suburbia, I found myself, every day, riding in the back of a coworker’s car through the same endless miles of subdivisions. The houses usually did not even cast shadows, thanks to the unbroken cloud cover of central Ohio’s fall and winter months. Far from the mail-order version of country life that the fossil fuel economy envisioned, they felt more like a cartoonishly sad prison for money: rows and rows of giant, neutral-toned cells under one big ceiling the color of concrete.</p>



<p>We were door-to-door canvassers for Save the Children, or the ACLU, or whatever other non-profit had hired us to jailbreak suburban money for them that quarter. Nobody was happy to see us, especially when we accidentally knocked on their door twice in the same evening, which happened surprisingly often.</p>



<p>In our defense, it was very difficult to tell visually if we had already been to a certain house. Just like in 90’s UO, they all conformed to a small range of styles, and they were all decorated from the same catalogue of accoutrements; after all, everybody bought their stuff from the same Target or Walmart up the road. Recognizing a <em>Welcome Friends </em>doormat, or the <em>No Solicitors </em>sign on a door, didn’t mean anything when half the houses on the street had the same one</p>



<p>At the end
of every shift,
we’d pass the
same neighborhood in the opposite direction, having taken in six hours
of vitriol, cynicism, and misery from the people
who lived there.
I’d almost feel guilty, leaving them behind.
Like we were
marooning them, in those bleak,
angry houses, sitting
on their shitty, everyday-low-priced dragon
hoards. I’d watch
them disappear in the rearview
and think about how this was the best thing
to do in the suburbs:
leave.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The biggest difference between the Columbus suburbs in 2009 and the UO suburbs in 1999 was the strangely open-door nature of UO’s prefab dwellings. Despite the ability to lock other players out, most homeowners left their front doors open for anyone who pleased to wander in. It made sense; other than extra storage space, all you could really use it for was a personal museum.</p>



<p>The security of houses meant
you could put your most treasured items
on display without
fear of theft. Generally, all you or anyone could
do with these
treasures was look
at them. Most
of the game’s coveted “rares”
were pure set-pieces, notable only for the fact that there
were so few of them: things like a whip,
or a deck of cards,
or a horse bridle, that
seemed like they
should have some
kind of function, but
didn’t. The early
days of UO were full
of these seemingly half-finished or abandoned features, which,
at least for me, was part of the charm.
But it also meant that the absolute
apex of the in-game economy was centered
around things that had no use, other
than bragging rights.</p>



<p>A place in UO’s suburbs,
when you got right down to it, was largely
a way to tell everyone passing by,
<em>look how much time
I have spent
here; look how
much gold I have, how
dedicated I am to this world. </em>All that time,
all that gold,
just to put
a summary of your gaming
experience into your
very own online money prison.</p>



<p>A curious player
working their way
through the overbuilt countryside had access
to shrine after shrine,
dedicated to each individual homeowner’s unique <em>Ultima Online </em>experience. The
true suburban bleakness of it was the fact that all of those
experiences were the same one: the one that led to
getting a house, by grinding
away in dungeons, chasing gold and rares (or not doing
those things, but paying real-world currency to other people
who had). Just
like the real
suburbs, everybody had
the same shit. Your
digital dragon hoard,
in a world where another
whole-ass dragon spawned
every few minutes.</p>



<p>I went off to college in ‘03, new owner of an Apple computer, unable to run UO or any other MMO except Everquest (which, ehhh). I left behind a game that I had watched, for years, try and fail to form a fully coherent play experience. I had loved most of its clumsy experiments to that end: the hideous, buggy 3D client that made people look like weird aliens, and the new monsters designed by <em>Spawn </em>creator Todd McFarlane, which looked like they’d been copy-pasted in from, like, a <em>Call of Cthulhu </em>game. But none of these had addressed the homogenized, consumeristic feel that the housing system had lent Brittannia, and over time, it felt less and less like the kind of escape I had sought as a 14-year-old private school fugitive. Leaving UO, in the end, felt like a relief; after all, that’s the best thing you can do in the suburbs. </p>



<p>I departed for the East Coast, to go try and be someone else. For real, this time. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After playing hours and hours and hours of a so-called “open world” game that simulated a wilderness realm in which I was an outlaw and member of a gang of men and women and children who lived together in a camp on a wooded plateau not far from a town called “Valentine”; and after I had learned to ride a horse and that I needed to maintain a good relationship with this horse by frequently patting it and saying, “yes that’s a good boy” and brushing his mane and feeding it “classic oatcakes”; and after riding my horse through the woods and smashing into trees and flying out of the saddle; and after feeding the horse something called “horse reviver” and myself a “miracle tonic” to restore our health; and after getting drunk at the local saloon and walking in on a harlot and cowboy having sex in one of the rooms; and after tracking deer through snowdrifts in an alpine forest and bringing one down with the bow I’d been carrying by sandwiching my torso between the handle and string; and after skinning the deer by unzipping its pelt from the marbled musculature of its body, as I would do every time I hunted and killed animals in this world, a collection that would include jackrabbits, elk, foxes, mule deer, black bear, and grizzly bear; and after visiting a camp where I lived with other outlaws, to eat stew or drink whiskey and watch the firelight cast its shadows upon the faces of my friends, who sang ditties like “ring dang do, now what is that, got a hole in the middle and it’s split in two”; and after fudging a bank robbery and failing to lasso the man guarding the caboose on a moving steam train; and after marveling at distant mountain vistas that called to mind the Rocky Mountains; and after rescuing a miscreant from prison by yanking a hole in the jail wall; and after various shootouts with lawmen and locals and bounty hunters; and after accidentally discharging my firearm in a city that resembled New Orleans and being set upon by constables who shot me dead; and after pouring moonshine on the leaves of a tobacco field and setting it ablaze with a kind of Molotov cocktail, and pausing to watch cinders ride air currents like demonic fireflies; and after robbing and deciding to choke rather than simply beat a few random folk in back alleys; and after lassoing and hog-tying a random stranger who, after I’d stowed him on the back of my horse, exclaimed, “Jiminy cocksuckers!”; and after hijacking and stealing stagecoaches and Conestoga wagons and delivering them to a barn where a balding man with long stringy side hair purchased my stolen goods, no matter how poor the condition; and after eating cans of baked beans and peaches and logs of salted beef and crackers and hunks of bread and cheese and cooking game with a knife held over a campfire; and after entering random houses and stealing pocket watches and rings and tonics of all varieties and shooting homeowners who gave me shit and then attempting to track down witnesses and murder them before they could tattle to local deputies; and after helping strangers unlock bear traps from their legs or suck snake venom from thighs; and after pausing to note rays of sunlight shooting like projector beams through evergreens; and after riding through fog and rain and snow; and after attacking a group of Klansmen holding some kind of initiation ritual deep in the woods and getting my ass handed to me; and after my world fading to black and the word “dead” appearing in a red saloon-style font, I decided that perhaps I ought to pause gameplay and get some fresh air, so I donned a bodysuit that, in real life, makes me look sort of like a Power Ranger, then climbed upon my bike and rode off the plateau where I lived, down into the valley, where I began to marvel, as I had upon encountering the resplendent facsimiles offered by the game I’d recently been playing, at the idiosyncrasies of the world through which I traveled: the fissures cracking across glittering asphalt; the way that dual cab trucks seemed to spawn, one after the other, as soon as I left the town’s limits; the dimpled surface of a stream; the waxy netting snugly fitted over hay bales; the sun streak on the wing of a crow; lichen-smudged fence posts; swirls of wood grain; the furrows of tire tread in a meadow; a branch in autumn’s webbed canopy undulating as a squirrel moved across it; a rotting IROC beneath the fallen boards of a disintegrating barn; the dusty pelt of an opossum, flattened on the road as thin as if it had been run over by a cartoon steamroller; the leaden water of a pond orbited by cattails; the tangle of a tree’s exposed roots, looking like tentacles clinging to the cleft of a mud bank, and giving the impression that this tree might at any moment get up and walk away; the rotting log cabin sadly branded with a private property slash no trespassing sign; and I couldn’t help but think to myself, every time, <em>how convincing, how oh so very real</em>.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am thirteen when my grandfather dies.</p>
<p>I play <em>Dead or Alive 3</em> on my brother’s Xbox. This is one of the few games I am decent at. I am decent at it because it’s a button masher. I frenzy on the controller and often manage to stumble on a sequence that produces a combo attack. It takes little skill, finesse, or memorization. It just requires I go at it again and again. My brother tells me I only win because my attacks are so random, without logic, that the computer can’t predict and defend.</p>
<p>The <em>DOA</em> girls are beautiful. I want their soft-brown, long hair with perfect edges and messy bangs. I want their short, pink pixie hair and unblemished skin. I want to live in a world that’s shiny, everything high gloss. When I am older I will understand that these anime women are the real reason for the game’s popularity. I will understand that <em>DOA Xtreme Beach Volleyball</em> was actually just a means to show these women bounce around in insanely impractical and revealing bikinis. At the time, I didn’t see the point of the theatrical interludes of the women playing joyfully on a tropical beach, of women slowly emerging from hot tubs. I thought<em>, Finally, a sports game for girls like me! </em></p>
<p>When I come home from school my parents meet me by the door and tell me my grandfather has died. They hug me and cry, but I don’t really cry. I go to my room and do my homework, and when I am older I will learn the term “dissociation.” I will learn that I have been dissociating for years, for decades.</p>
<p>My grandfather died in the spring and I spent what, in my memory, was my entire spring break playing <em>DOA 3.</em> My parents were at work or dealing with the aftermath. An entire house of stuff to sort through: boxes of <em>National Geographic </em>magazines, WWII fighter pilot uniforms, native Alaskan art, a garage brimming with scraps of wood and metal for projects that would never come to be. They were busy trying to find a way forward with my grandmother who had never lived alone, who didn’t know how to be without my grandfather. I did not know how to be without my grandfather, who took us for shopping sprees at Sam Goody. Shuttled us between afterschool activities. Bought us Dairy Queen on summer afternoons. Just a year before his death, he had crafted a longsword out of wood and helped me design and spray paint a suit of armor to wear for a class project. But I did not think about any of this then. I played <em>DOA</em>. I wondered if I could go without sleep, without food, without stepping outside. I didn’t question why I wanted this.</p>
<p>Now, my therapist says I am not connected to my body. She asks what emotions I feel and then asks where I feel them in my body. I guess, <em>uhm, like a heaviness in my chest? Like a heaviness in my stomach? Like tense? In my shoulders? </em></p>
<p>A new Modest Mouse album came out the same month my grandfather died, so, while playing <em>DOA</em>, I listened to <em>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</em> over and over on the boombox. I remember the sliding screen door being open, it was perfectly spring outside, the music feeling so in season. There was a dreamy lightness that buoyed me. The songs twangy and reverberating, the lyrics echoing and looping, at some moments sounding upbeat and frantic, at others a lullaby. I was in a trance.</p>
<p>The day before the funeral, we took my grandmother to the mortuary to see the body, to make sure everything looked <em>right.</em> Upon seeing him, hands folded on his chest, clean-shaven, in a casket, my grandmother said through tears that it didn’t look like him, he needed more rouge, he had always had such color in his cheeks. I knew then that this body was not my grandfather, that no amount of rouge could make it seem anything like him. I knew then that bodies were not people.</p>
<p>In meditation, my mind takes me to memories, and the memories are blank rooms I stand in. I stand in the basement of the church my grandparents went to, where every Sunday after mass, coffee and pastries were served. Where I sat in a white, button-up shirt with black, vertical stripes after my grandfather’s funeral, feeling like my clothes never fit right, embarrassed by my bout of stifled sobs that manifested into silent convulsions during the service. The tremor had run through me unexpectedly and filled me with shame before it sank into nothingness. I stand in my sister’s room where, during summer, I’d sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor because her room had window AC and mine didn’t. Her metal windchimes softly singing in the fan breeze. I am driving, I live in Tucson. I grip the wheel. What does it feel like? I look at my fingers.<em> The cat observes itself, </em>I think. I’m at the edge of the yard at my parents’ house in Pennsylvania, right where it begins to dip in a steep curve, the bank of the creek below obscured through tangles of trees. I’m digging up the shoebox we buried my sister’s guinea pig in last week—just to make sure. Except I’m not there, it’s an open hole and I can’t make out the contents. I’m standing in my grandparents’ kitchen, a painting of a man praying over bread above the dining table, there is a saucepan of melted butter on the stove for popcorn and soon my fingers will be slick with it. What did my grandparents couch feel like? Their carpet? Their hands? I can see it, but it’s nowhere in my body.</p>
<p>Each fight in <em>DOA</em> takes less than two minutes. When I got knocked out, I could hit <em>Continue </em>and retry on an infinite loop. The gameplay was repetitive, every level, every fight, just like the last. No character development to speak of and the story basically nonexistent, a loose shell for endless hand-to-hand combat. I liked the elegant movements, the gliding leg sweeps, the swift jabs. I liked being a cog in the never-ending system. I easily died hundreds of times that week as several different women. Against a tree in a forest filled with foliage, on the glass floor of an aquarium, while falling through the mist of a waterfall before landing on a mossy pillar of rock. The game’s graphics were beautiful and entrancing, like watching a screensaver while I waited for my life to buffer.</p>
<p>By the end of that spring break, I had accomplished something I never had before—I beat all of my brother’s high scores in a video game. I remember him being incredulous and kind of annoyed. I had beaten his scores not through skill but through sheer input, the way someone plays slots until hitting gold. He set to it and easily overtook my scores in a matter of days. That didn’t matter though. For that week, I had become the game. I existed in falling cherry blossoms, in paper-walled pagodas, in ice caves. I was a fierce warrior woman who was also so physically without flaw, without a wrinkle on her skintight dress with slits up past her hips, with enormous breasts, my god! The CD ends and I hit the <em>Play</em> button again. I hit <em>Continue</em> as the Game Over clock counts down from ten. I am in the room now but I can’t touch anything, I am years away from myself.</p>
<p>That spring, I get dental surgery and abuse painkillers for the first time. We paint the house my grandparents lived in and prepare it for sale. I cover my backpack in patches and squishy cartoon animal keychains that my grandfather had bought us, I scribble on them with Sharpie and poke paperclips through like voodoo dolls. I read <em>A Brief History of Time</em> and Shakespeare’s sonnets during study period. I read the words and retain nothing. I wait for the school year to end, for me to become a high school freshman. I feel blank. My hands act on the controller without me knowing which buttons are hit. Things happen on the screen and I’m unsure the cause. It’s all random. Sometimes you’re dead. Sometimes you’re alive. Sometimes both.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a sentence that I never expected myself, or <em>anyone,</em> to write, but that is nonetheless true: <em>Pokémon Red</em> was too real for me.</p>
<p>This is not to say that it wasn’t a work of genius—outdated graphics, monotonous gameplay and all. The late 90s culture that it arrived in was awash in collection-based fads, most of which would play themselves out by the end of the decade. Pogs, Beanie Babies, Longaberger baskets (whose company headquarters, an office building in Dresden, Ohio shaped like a giant basket itself, currently sits abandoned, a testament to the era’s bizarre craze and excess), and others have long since ceased to be anything more than sources of ironic reminiscence for those of us who lived through their heyday. <em>Pokémon </em>and <em>Magic: the Gathering </em>are the only modern-day survivors of this proliferation to maintain their popularity over time, and for good reason.</p>
<p>What it came down to, especially in the case of <em>Pokémon, </em>was the way they recognized, intentionally or not, that the attraction of collectible fads was not the actual items collected, but the act of collecting them. Once you have a Beanie Baby, or issue #1 of a comic book, you’ve got it. That’s it. There’s nothing more to do than let it collect dust—or, more accurately, do everything in your power to <em>prevent</em> <em>it </em>from collecting dust, which might cause its condition to degrade, in anticipation of its future resale value. But with <em>Pokémon </em>and <em>Magic,</em> the thrill of the hunt never ends. There will always be another edition, another installment in the series, another deck to build, another gym leader to defeat. <em>Magic</em> offers tournaments. And with <em>Pokémon, </em>you can always reset the game and start fresh, all 151 of them (remember, we’re talking about <em>Red </em>here) once again ahead of you.</p>
<p>Its U.S. release came a few weeks after the start of my 8<sup>th</sup> grade school year, which made me just barely too old to be able to enjoy it unironically without serious social consequences in my middle-class, Columbus, Ohio setting. This didn’t stop me from putting a few dozen hours into it. Amidst the flood of collection fads, even kids couldn’t keep track of all of them, and I managed a play-through before most of the kids in my grade knew enough about what <em>Pokémon </em>was to make fun of it.</p>
<p>And it was, beyond a doubt, too real.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s what I learned about <em>Pokémon Red</em> from my one play-through: the hero’s default name is Ash, and unlike his anime counterpart, he has no voice, no friends, and no goals of his own.</p>
<p>He spends the game wandering through similar-looking fields, between similar-looking towns, performing the same tasks with gradually higher numbers attached. Things happen to him and around him, but he doesn’t exactly drive the plot in any way. No urgency or desire seems to compel him along his journey; he wants only what he is told to want by the NPCs he encounters.</p>
<p>He is subject to a one-sided rivalry with a kid named Gary, who will not leave Ash alone despite his complete lack of any expressed interest in said rivalry. Gary is so obsessed with one-upping Ash that he becomes the champion of the coveted Indigo League, purely for the purpose of challenging and defeating Ash when he arrives there. If Ash ever thinks twice about Gary, we never see it. For Ash, Gary is just another trainer to defeat.</p>
<p>The institutions he interacts with (Pokémon training, gym battles, Team Rocket) are of great importance to the game’s world, but <em>he</em> is not. He might as well be anybody else who is assigned to accomplish the prescribed goals of his host society. As a character, he is indistinguishable from the long succession of mostly nameless trainers he battles during the course of the game. Aside from the player’s ability to direct his actions by pressing buttons, he is basically an NPC himself. His quest to become “the very best, like no one ever was” (a phrase that only appears in the anime, with no equally grand sentiment appearing anywhere in the game) is not so much a Hero’s Journey as it is a Kafkaesque nightmare.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of Kafkaesque nightmares, here are a few facts about me as an 8<sup>th</sup> grader in the days before anyone had the gall to call 8<sup>th</sup> graders “Middle School seniors”:</p>
<p>After years of being on the receiving end of my school’s active bullying scene, I had gained some tentative acceptance among the popular crowd. Relatively safe from harm, I was still very much aware of the fact that I was an outsider in the group, less accepted <em>per se </em>than tolerated. I had learned to put on the right clothes and use the right slang, but it was more important that I never give them a reason to question whether I should really be there. I could never fight with anyone, because it would be too easy for everyone to side with the more established friend, and then all the work I had put into making myself safe would fall apart.</p>
<p>I spent a lot more time going to the woods by myself than I did hanging out with other kids my age, partly because I valued my alone time, but mostly it was a relief from the pressure of having to perform popular-ness. I did this so often, my Dad thought I must be secretly dating a girl, which was something I knew better than to do. Dating people usually involves eventually breaking up with them, and breaking up with someone usually involves fighting with them, and I could never fight anyone. I could have brought my Game Boy with me to the woods to play <em>Pokémon Red, </em>but I never did.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s another, more important fact about me in 8<sup>th</sup> grade: growing up in the ‘90s in a middle class household, with a dad who also happened to be first-generation Holocaust diaspora, presented me with a lot of mixed signals.</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I received a lot of participation trophies, which lived briefly on top of my dresser, and then in a box under my bed until I could secretly dispose of them without hurting anyone’s feelings. Middle-class 90s kids got a lot of encouragement. A lot of “if you work hard, you can achieve anything you set your heart on.” Be the very best, like no one ever was. Never mind that all of your classmates are being told the exact same thing; any of you might as well be any other one of you, in that sense.</p>
<p>But in my case, there was also a lot of pressure not to stand out <em>too much</em>, or in the wrong ways, because very bad things can happen to you when you do that. Previous generations in my family had gotten this message in the harshest way possible. The habits it made them prone to were and are hard to shake off, especially when acceptance of Jewish people and culture in America was and is short-standing and tentative. Much like my own social standing at the time.</p>
<p>The synthesis of all this was a constant mandate to grind out grades and personal achievements, working toward a nebulous idea of The American Dream whose specifics never quite solidified. Making honor roll was a worthy goal, but any kind of genuine personal fulfillment had to be kept off the radar. “If you work hard, you can achieve anything you set your heart on, as long as you don’t set your heart on anything in particular.” The very best, but the very best what, exactly? Unclear. The reason for wanting to get on honor roll could be nothing more than moving on to the next grade and working toward making honor roll there.</p>
<p>Similar fields, similar towns. Same tasks, gradually higher numbers attached. Wants only what they are told to want.</p>
<p>An NPC in my own game. My entire life, a collection fad with no purpose other than to endlessly continue collecting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s what I really mean when I say that <em>Pokémon Red</em> was too real for me: I understand the comfort afforded by an endless grind for which the only reward is more grind, perhaps a little too well. It’s about maintaining the appearance of working toward something, without the pressure of having to derive any ultimate fulfillment from whatever it is.</p>
<p>At some point I looked at Ash’s blank-faced, monochrome avatar and noticed that the biggest thing we shared, more than an interest in collecting <em>Pokémon </em>or being the very best, was the inability to express any real joy in the moments when we achieved what we were supposed to want.</p>
<p>I saw him standing in what looked much like any other patch of high-grass in the game and wondered if maybe he had just been wandering around that same field outside of Pallet Town the whole time. Thought about how he could do exactly that and, at a glance, it would look like he was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing. Realized that we were both caught in a cycle, always fixated on preparing to move on to the next phase of our lives, which leads to nothing except an eventual preparation for death.</p>
<p>At the end of <em>Pokémon Red</em>, Ash defeats the Elite Four and his self-proclaimed rival and becomes the new champion, and the result of this is <em>nothing</em>. The result is that you either reset the game or wait for the next installment of the series to come out so that you can do it all again, from the beginning. Even in the end, the only reward is repetition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was eleven, I convinced my dad to buy <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. </i>The pictures—Link in his green tunic, mostly—reminded me of <i>King’s Quest</i>, which I had watched him puzzle through on our computer. My dad had played video games as long as video games had existed, and he was always willing to invest in a new toy. Instead of playing OoT ourselves, my brother, Blake, and I watched him play through it. My dad was the training coordinator (a position I later realized was significantly less fancy than I thought) at Papa John’s, so sometimes he was home during a weekday. Once, I was home sick and helped him solve the puzzles in the Spirit Temple. Another time, he intentionally didn’t save his progress so when I got home from school he could show me King Zora squeaking aside to open the path to Lord Jabu Jabu. (I still make that squeaking noise when I’m squeezing past someone in a hallway or scooching over on a bench.)</p>
<p>When he finally went head to head with Ganon, it took forever. He couldn’t shoot light arrows accurately enough, or he ran out of magic, or he would fall jumping to slash Ganon with the Master Sword. Later, watching Blake play, I realized that part hadn’t been particularly hard—my dad was just not as good at video games as I thought he was.</p>
<p>But he was still a lot better than I was.</p>
<hr />
<p>The year before<i> OoT</i>, I had saved up money in the summer doing odd jobs for my grandparents to buy an original Game Boy (used, missing the battery cover) and <i>Pokèmon Blue</i>. Other kids in my neighborhood had been playing it, I watched the anime in the morning, and I was obsessed. I loved the idea of little creatures, and I loved the idea of collecting things. But most of all, I loved that the turn-based style of play meant little-to-no stress on my part. I didn’t have to worry about the timing of my button pressing. I could strategize. I could win.</p>
<p>The first day, I played from the moment I got it until I fell asleep. I went through twelve batteries. When I closed my eyes, the phosphenes I saw behind my eyelids were pixelated.</p>
<p>On my first playthrough, I did not learn that I should maybe have more than one strong Pokèmon if I expected to breeze through the Elite Four, so I looked up the Missingno. cheat and rare-candied my way to victory.</p>
<p>But I did it! I beat the game. I have since beaten it one other time, on winter break of my junior year of undergrad.</p>
<p>In sitting down to write this essay, I was trying to figure out how many video games I’ve beaten. I’m not talking “completed” here; for example, I never caught ‘em all in <i>Pokèmon Blue</i> (let’s be real, I didn’t have enough (<i>i.e.</i>, any) friends to trade with even if I had gotten close). I asked myself: how many games have I beaten the main quest of and gotten the credits to scroll?</p>
<p>It’s one. It’s <i>Pokèmon Blue. </i></p>
<hr />
<p>As a high schooler in the mid-aughts, I volunteered at a place called the Lower Paxton Youth Center. In a squat, one-story, cinderblock building owned by the township, we had poetry readings, vegan dinners, and other weird art events. Our main events, however, were shows: little concerts with local and touring bands. I was on the youth board as secretary, so I was intimately involved with running the place. I sold wristbands at the door. I sold pizza by the slice. I talked to bands between sets. I learned their lyrics and screamed them. I waltzed; I threw my body around; I was a part of it.</p>
<p>However, a group of people came to shows that we, the kids who booked the shows and ran the venue, despised: the scene kids. These were our peers that didn’t care about the music. They didn’t want to contribute to the community. Instead, they wanted to be there because of the <i>scene</i>. Which, of course, meant they wanted to <i>be</i> <i>seen</i>.</p>
<p>When thinking about the way I love video games, my first thought was: <i>Am I a fraud?</i> But this I quickly dismissed. I wasn’t lying, per se. Then, I realized my real question: <i>Am I scene kid? </i></p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s the thing. I’m not good at video games. I was good at <i>Pokèmon Blue </i>for two reasons: 1) It was turned based, and 2) I cheated. (Though, the second time I beat it, I won because I patiently trained my Pokèmon in the tall grass and also spent much of my early days getting a Gyrados.)</p>
<p>In Alyse Knorr’s book <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, she writes about how the muscle memory of beating Bowser came back even fifteen years after she had last played: “My <i>SMB3</i> skills came as a result of hours and hours of childhood practice—enough, statistically speaking, to achieve true ‘expert’ status.” My husband, Kenny, also has these moves stitched into his being. On Friday nights, he’ll often suggest we drink Scotch, order pizza, and play <i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>, switching back and forth as we beat or lose each level. What this turns into is Kenny effortlessly running and hopping through each level, taking secret paths to collect extra coins, and knowing precisely when to employ different suits, while I try to jump over a chasm and instead jump directly into the center of the chasm.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Kenny said to me one night, after I had died all of fifteen seconds into a level. “You really look like you’re intentionally trying to fall down those chasms.”</p>
<p>I never learned these patterns of muscle memory, partly because I’m less interested in games without explicit stories, partly from watching my friends and family play video games more often than playing them myself. At this point in my life, as a writer, working as an editor, with a baby to take care of, I will likely never put in the effort to learn them. This timing involved with pressing buttons in early classics like Super Mario doesn’t exactly transfer to the modern games I’m more interested in, like <i>Skyrim</i>, but those skills definitely seem to help.</p>
<hr />
<p>I would say my favorite game series is still Zelda. I’ve dressed up as Link for Halloween more than once (this upcoming Halloween, I plan on being Link, Kenny is going to be a gender-bent Prince Zelda, and our son will wear a chicken hat; he’s going to be a cucco), I own a Link-tunic hoodie with the Hylian shield sewn to the back and a pointy hood to cap it off, and recently I took pictures of myself and my son wearing matching Link outfits. When my son cries in his sleep, I sneak into his room and sing him “Epona’s Song.” It always calms him down. I picked this to be his lullaby in part because it’s my favorite Zelda song (and the more obvious “Zelda’s Lullaby” has notes that are too high) and because, like most video game tunes, it’s meant to repeat on a loop: a perfect way to sing a lullaby for thirty seconds or three minutes. I sang it often when he was still in utero, instilling it as comfort even before he was born.</p>
<p>But all this said, I haven’t even beaten my favorite game, the one I started with: <i>Ocarina of Time</i>. I have tried many times since my dad beat it. I can easily navigate the Great Deku Tree, Dodongo’s Cavern, and Lord Jabu-Jabu’s Belly. Once, I got stuck at the Water Temple (a classic spot to fail). The last time I tried, I got stuck in the Gerudo Fortress. Even looking up how to sneak past the busty Gerudo women, I couldn’t figure it out.</p>
<p>I have played about two thirds of<i> Skyward Sword</i>, but it’s taken me years. In <i>Skyward Sword</i>, you have trials you must complete in the Silent Realm before moving on to the dungeon for that area. In each trial, you transport to a ghostly parallel version of a map you’ve already encountered. Here, you have to collect Sacred Tears. Sounds easy enough, except that there are terrifying shells of armor called Guardians that will come after you with their huge weapons (along with heart-pounding music) if you: 1) take too long to find the next Sacred Tear, 2) are seen by Watchers, these creepy ghost things with lanterns, or 3) touch silvery water (that’s usually ebbing around a Sacred Tear). One hit from a Guardian ends the trial, and you have to start over.</p>
<p>The first time I played through the first Silent Realm, I yelled the entire time. Zelda games, with a few notable exceptions, tend not to be scary (at least not like one of Kenny’s favorite franchises, <i>Silent Hill</i>), but these sections, with their creepy twilight, all-encompassing danger, and ambient music really stressed me out. I, of course, lost my first trial in the Silent Realm and my second. Kenny was sleeping (he had not appreciated my yelling), so I put the game away and didn’t play again for six months. Finally, with Kenny’s emotional support and the volume turned down a bit, I got through the first trial. I beat the dungeon and then, with another Silent Realm waiting for me, got scared and put the game away for another six months. I am still in the middle of this process. Since I started the game, I have gotten accepted into an MFA program, gotten married, completed my MFA program, gotten a job, and had a baby.</p>
<hr />
<p>The truth of the matter is I’d prefer to watch someone play video games than play them myself. I want to read video-game specific wikis about them, I want to sing my son “Epona’s Song,” I want to have Kenny cross stitch me a Triforce for my desk at work, I want to read books about the history of video games like Alyse’s book, I want to dress up as Link for Halloween, and I want to buy the <i>Silent Hill Soundtrack</i> on vinyl from EBay as a surprise for Kenny because he missed buying it from the source before it sold out. But I only sometimes want to actually play video games. I’d rather sit snuggled on the couch as my baby sleeps, knitting him a cucco hat for Halloween while I watch my husband play through the demo of <i>Prey, </i>yelling and laughing in surprise when a mimic appears.</p>
<p>As much as I can admit this, I can’t help but hate myself a little bit for it. I can’t help but see myself as a scene kid. Because there’s something logically flawed to the idea of rejecting the fundamental purpose of video games: playing them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Walking to the parking garage at work, I hear three tech dudes talking beside me. These guys always exit the office around the same time I’m leaving for the day, strolling to have a smoke away from the building’s main entrance. I hear one of them say, “Oh yeah, and <i>Half-Life</i> <i>2</i> was so glitchy. My copy let me walk right up to the G-man.”</p>
<p>“A-ha,” I say, interjecting myself into their conversation, “but what’s better? A glitchy game or a game that doesn’t exist at all?” I am, of course, implying that the imperfect <i>Half-Life 2 </i>was better than the non-existent and long yearned-for <i>Half-Life 3.</i></p>
<p>The three men size me up. I am not only a woman but a pregnant one. Do I really know what I’m saying here? I’ve made a safe entrance into this conversation, because I’m going to pass them to get to my car, so I know they won’t be able to probe my knowledge much. Admittedly, I’m more familiar with <i>Portal</i>, the spin-off puzzle game in the same universe, than I am with the <i>Half-Life</i> games. Finally, after what seems like a long time, but is really only a few steps, they chuckle.</p>
<p>“Good point,” one says.</p>
<p>In my car, I feel oddly triumphant (I call Kenny immediately to tell him) but also mad at myself. I don’t actually want to be friends with these dudes, nor do I feel any need to impress them. But in that moment, I wanted them to know their conversation wasn’t exclusive. I wanted them to know that I, too, know about video games.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You couldn&#8217;t blame her: the weeks prior had thrown trees through places trees have never been, had torn scars through asphalt, neighbors pouring out from front doors that no longer exist: children stomping on anthills to watch insects stronger than we&#8217;ll ever be tangle their bodies together to escape the caving in of all they have built.</p>
<p>But nothing about the game was real: not in how his grotesque mouth would open to nothing, how those were textures that didn&#8217;t deserve mapping. Here, a place that doesn&#8217;t deserve the shaping of polygons, of how we dig with our hands &amp; still say the wrong thing at dinner tables, we suffer despite not knowing what exists outside of cages: that the world around us knows more about where we are than we do—us, brooms in hand bringing whatever we could gather because gathering is the only thing that we could possibly think to do.</p>
<p>In the game, he is more superhuman than he is in real life: muscles swollen out from underneath low-rising socks—a man who can expose skin because he is not worried about exposure to the brambles left behind by the wind—someone who can bleed and not think anything of it because there has been nothing left to rust. There is no blood. No broken glass from beer bottles or blown out windows: how the weather can cause things so false: that there are shapes on maps, that there are colored splotches that signify that it is going to rain soon, and it will take everything that you have.</p>
<p>Instead, we have a version of a man who is a version of a man that he has always been: undeviating in anything but his stature—wristbands like the ones he wore on television, a military salute at the beginning of the ramp. He walks in small steps: head always focused on his opponent—as if there is nothing else in the world that we can focus on except the task at hand: we tend to forget about what is happening beyond where we are—a beautiful thing when we are in love, when we are asking for the world&#8217;s admiration, yet heartbreaking when there are rumors of dead bodies being found in the bottom of the lake, a set of bones caught in a basement.</p>
<p>And yet there he was, as inevitable as a news ticker: a statement of a fact, a prayer gone half-answered: the crowd around him moving in a patterned unison—they do not deviate from their purpose; arms go up and out and loop until the match is over or the console shuts off.</p>
<p>As a child, none of this would&#8217;ve been possible: the recreation of our heroes too muddled to be taken seriously—a representative on a curved screen; our champion here as a pale blob in blue shorts; nothing differentiating himself from the idols of his past or the devils of his present. As a child, I wouldn&#8217;t have been trusted to cook pots of red beans—I would not have known to let them soak: they would come out hard and bitter; everything would be ruined, and we would all go hungry: everyone would leave this place because there is no weight to hold us down, and us too would break pattern into something a bit more believable—separate ways until we are the ones at the bottom of lakes, that instead of being picked up we are driven downward—a cyclone in reverse, a drill downward that places us underneath the dirt with no knowledge of what direction to climb.</p>
<p>And perhaps this is why these days we don&#8217;t believe in gravity: a leap with a man on his back before sending him crashing to the floor. We beg buttons to try to coax our men to get up because this is what we were taught to do when we were young: that there was something that we could do if we were down and out on the floor, eyes to the fluorescent lights—that this is our natural reaction: to try to put action into something that has been long left dormant. And so when someone walks in and mistakes what is on the television for something real, despite the fact that this is an artifice of an artifice of an artifice, I cannot fault them: that there are dust clouds where houses once stood and they are dissipating on the wind—that we will give directions in regards to where things once were—that despite one&#8217;s desire to change: to become something new, to reinvent, to wave a hand over a different face, we are still locked into an array of repetition, of not seeing things that we can no longer see, but seeing the absence so clearly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Nature of Remembering</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">It has been said that remembering is replaying what you felt about those memories the previous time you thought about them, not actually recalling the remembered event itself. Is this why false memories are difficult to avoid, why eye witness accounts are unreliable, and why bad memories are hard to forget? Because memories are simply just reiterations of opinion, a refilling of downstream ponds and lakes, and not a reflection of the source?</span></p>
<p>Nobel Prize winning research has shown that the memories of place are stored in special neurons in the hippocampus in the brain. When the directions of a place are committed to memory, the neurons responsible for storing the recollection grow and change. The neurons that store the memory of place constitute a map of the space that is remembered. Thus, in order to recall the directions of a place and orient successfully in it, we must become that place, and it must become us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">I play together with the same kinship members almost every night. We go to the six-player dungeons to beat the bosses there, chat, and have fun. If we don&#8217;t get a full group, we go anyway. We&#8217;ve done the fights so many times, know the tactics so well, we can do it with fewer people or less able or less well-geared players than the encounters are meant for. We&#8217;re flexible enough to change the strategy where that is possible to suit the group, and know where we need to follow tried and true methods. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> When we&#8217;re not in the six-player dungeons, we grind trait stats together, characteristics that give our avatars minor but selectable advantages. Increasing the traits means having to kill several hundreds of a particular opponent in a specific place. It&#8217;s boring and monotonous work, and almost impossible to do if there are more than a few others doing the same in the area. But as a group we round up all the nearby mobs, then take them down in a heap. It&#8217;s substantially faster than doing it alone, and much more fun. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">We also do the twelve- and twenty-four-player fights, the hardest encounters in the game, called raids in MMOs. Not only are these fights the hardest, they are also the most difficult to organize, but reward successful players with the best gear in the game, and renown for the kinship. That&#8217;s secondary to me. I want to fight the hardest bosses of the game just for the sake of it. If it had been possible to do all alone, I would have, with no reward at all. But raiding is time-consuming. It needs a balanced number of participants from each class who must be willing to learn the fights and train together. I join the kinship&#8217;s newly formed raiding group because I&#8217;m willing to train, can spare the time, and am eager to become a better player. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> Once I join the raiding I love it, like a Viking. It&#8217;s crazy, chaotic, demanding. Sometimes just a single boss fight lasts for more than thirty minutes and the whole process takes hours. First, the way to the boss must be cleared of clusters of enemies, who while smaller than the boss, are much more numerous and stronger than the opponents out in the rest of the game. After an hour or two of this, we finally reach the boss, who has hundreds of thousands of hit points, is several levels higher than we are, and has scripted special attacks to unleash on us. Most raid boss encounters require us to use the architecture of the room and objects inside it to our advantage to protect us from the boss&#8217; attacks, to separate the smaller enemies that occasionally flood the room away from the boss to be picked down one by one, or we must split up into smaller groups to attack different parts of the boss. Raiding also requires good gear, and certain supplies to be used during the fight. Once the encounter starts no one can enter or leave the area until either the boss or the raid group is dead. Usually it&#8217;s us ending up on the floor and having to respawn to another location and run back to the last door to the boss room. If we spend too much time dying at the boss, the clusters of enemies will return and we must clear the way again. Therefore, time is always short. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-US">On any given night the first few hours are the best, when people are energetic and awake. The last hour is usually the worst, when we&#8217;re tired and hungry, and spouses and partners start demanding that we come to bed. Hence, most raids end at eleven at night and rarely go on past twelve. However, with a range of three time zones for Finns, Scandinavians, players from the Low Countries, and Brits, the time difference can sometimes be an issue. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> But raiding is so much fun. The harder and busier and more complex the fight is the more fun I think it is. To many players, raiding is too repetitive and takes too much time, but I love it. Best of all is when an encounter is completely new and we move carefully into the large space with the boss without knowing what it will do, which adds will come, or whether there are any traps or doors or keys we need to use during the fight. It&#8217;s a question of reading the boss&#8217; attacks, see what advantages the architecture gives us, being highly familiar the skills of the player classes and using them correctly, and know where to stand and what to do, when. Every fight has to be memorized, and the right equipment and supplies brought along on the avatar. The only way to learn a raid is to do it again and again and that means dying, again and again. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">Although F. is the guild leader, most raids are led by D., E., or P. We mostly do twelve-player raids, as we rarely have enough people online at the same time to go to the twenty-four-player fights. That&#8217;s less and less of a problem, though, because the game developers realize the twenty-four-player fights are too large and create the next raid for twelve only.</span></p>
<p>Twelve is a good number, a good size. It&#8217;s large enough for complex fight mechanics and multitasking, such as splitting the raid group, to be possible, but small enough to avoid the number of players needed being the biggest obstacle against arranging the raids, which often is the case with the twenty-four-player fights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">Even boss fights that are solved and familiar can go wrong if the raid group is imbalanced, has too many new players who don&#8217;t know the fight, or too many players with inappropriate gear or skills. But it&#8217;s not always easy to tell why things go badly.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> One such time we&#8217;re slogging our way through a network of caves that has five smaller bosses and a big one, a balrog, at the end. Even though several of us have been there before, tonight we can barely get the first boss down, and even the clusters of trash mobs who stand about in the tunnels and hallways, give us challenges. We wipe at nearly every group. We die and run back, through the winding caves and tunnels to the next group of trash mobs who pummel us into virtual submission. As always happens in these situations, someone starts to question the tactics, we discuss them, try another approach, die again and run back, then reconfigure the groups, a few people leave, more join in. After a couple of more wipes, suddenly, people must go and make dinner, bathe the kids, get up early the next day. Because with every defeat, our weapons and armor incur damage that must be repaired, which costs money earned in the game. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> Raiding isn&#8217;t just challenging and repetitive, it&#8217;s also costly. And as with most other things in the game, it boils down to time. In-game money can easily be earned through gathering virtual materials that can be harvested in the game world, by crafting in-game items and selling them, or by hunting animals or enemies in the game. All of this requires time, because the game&#8217;s developer and publisher want us to spend as much time in it as possible so we pay the subscription fee for one more week, one more month, one more year. But for most players game time is limited, wedged in between work and studies and kids and lovers and friends and all our other duties and hobbies. Thus, time is definitely money, even in the game. In the failing raid we die and run back, die and run back, reconvene at the last spot where things went badly to try and shave off a few more trash mobs so we can reach the boss and make up for our poor performance on the way, our wounded pride, and have a chance at the hard-earned rewards. But tonight progress is too slow, too laborious to even reach the first boss. We die too many times until the tanks&#8217; gear breaks down, forcing them to leave the raid instance and return to the nearest camp to repair their weapons and armor. When the gear breaks down it no longer gives any protection against the mobs&#8217; attacks and none of the numerically calculated damage. One of the tanks who runs off to repair his gear types in the raid chat window that his wife wants him to put the kids to bed, and then he leaves the raid group. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;OK, let&#8217;s continue one more hour,&#8221; D., the raid leader, types in the raid chat window, but we can all feel the group creak in the seams. At one of the most difficult pulls in that section of the caves, which throws several trolls and mages at us, we die even faster and more frequently than we have done that night. Finally, our main offensive player, which is D., no longer has any functioning weapons. Right before we all die humiliatingly and tediously one last time, backed up against a grate in the cave wall while we&#8217;re getting pummeled by three trolls and about a dozen of their best friends, D. starts fighting the mobs with his avatar&#8217;s bare hands. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">However, the raids usually go much better than that and we have few problems clearing the instance. It&#8217;s great fun and we&#8217;re a good team, but little by little some of us want to leave the large kinship and join a smaller one or make our own. We try to get D. to join us, but he declines, even though he&#8217;s not entirely happy with the big kinship either. So we leave and several months pass. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> The few times I see D. he&#8217;s playing together with a female avatar whose name I don&#8217;t recognize. I ding D. in text chat, but he doesn&#8217;t reply and I don&#8217;t try more than once. Several more months pass till I see D. again. When it happens I&#8217;m in Trollshaws, which resembles a Norwegian forest, full of pine and spruce and oak, rowan, aspen, and birch. Despite the area being full of trolls and angry walking trees, it still looks beautiful and inviting. Since my avatar is now many levels higher than the bears, wolves, bats, deer, undead skeletons, and giant spiders in the area, I can ride through it without having the mobs aggroing on me. I finally know the lay of this land and make my way to the place where a named cold-worm, a large, lizard-like drakeling, appears. When it dies it drops a beryl shard, an item that is needed to make stronger weapons and armor. Thus, everyone want beryl shards, and most players have one or two named mobs they search for or camp to get. I call the worm &#8220;my little friend with genuine hand-made beryl shards&#8221;. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> As I ride up the last narrow valley to the worm lair I wonder who I&#8217;ll meet there tonight. I&#8217;m not the only player camping that worm. There&#8217;s usually a line. The first player in the queue kills the regular worm that spawns every five minutes or so until the named one appears. Then the player kills it, takes the shard, and leaves, making room for the next person in line. Since the named worm only appears every ten to fifteen spawn of normal mobs, the waiting time at the worm place can be an hour or more. Most people don&#8217;t bother waiting for more than half an hour or so, time being the usual premium in the game, and leave the queue if it takes too long time. Players who don&#8217;t leave after they get the shard ask for open competition about the worms instead of the courteous line, and become unpopular with other players on the server. Hence, most people queue up, and if they want more than one shard, they go to the back of the line to wait once more for their turn. It&#8217;s an amicable arrangement I&#8217;m not sure would have happened in other MMOs, or even on other servers in this game. This server is known for its good community and friendly interaction.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> Tonight, a familiar person is at the worm lair. It&#8217;s D. I select his avatar and /wave and say /hi to him. He dings me in the private chat window with a Hi! and How are you, long time no see! While we wait for the named worm we chat together for a good while. When it finally pops and D. takes the shard, I say </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;So nice to meet you again, glad we could catch up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; D. types back. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything unspoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you in Evendim a while back,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I sent you a direct message, but got no reply. I thought you didn&#8217;t want to talk to me anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, I must have been AFK,&#8221; D. says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see your message. Sometimes the kinnies make so many chat windows.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> I have no reason to disbelieve him, I know how easy it is to miss a message if several people are writing to you at the same time in private chat windows and the fellowship and kinship channels are busy at the same time. It gets confusing, however used to it or good at multitasking you are.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;So glad to hear that,&#8221; I say. We bid each other farewell. D. rides off down the slim, forest-clad valley while the area&#8217;s somber incidental music rattles and howls darkly.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">From then on I see D. almost every night at the worm lair. We chat about the game and the kinship and our personal lives. We talk a lot and it&#8217;s just like before, except we don&#8217;t play in the same group anymore. He tells me he doesn&#8217;t play much with his kinship, just organizes the raids, leads a few in between, but mostly crafts weapons and armor so his kinship members can have better gear. That&#8217;s why he camps the named worm night after night. I do the same because the beryl shards are easy to sell and I haven&#8217;t made money before in the game. I didn&#8217;t bother to, didn&#8217;t want earning in-game money to become another treadmill. I have a job in real life and don&#8217;t feel the need to get another in what&#8217;s supposed to be a relaxing side activity. </span></p>
<p>Once, D. shows me the shard droppers in Lothlórien.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many named mobs here,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s raining shards.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> I&#8217;ve only explored the Golden Woods while doing the area quests and leveling up on my way to Mirkwood. Now I just rush through the landscape, or circumvent it completely by fast traveling from Caras Galadhon, Galadriel&#8217;s town. Despite that, I find Lothlórien to be one of the most beautiful places in the game. Beneath a sky of mallorn canopies, wide tree trunk after tree trunk stretches into the game&#8217;s mist-filled draw distance. The deep green grass is covered with red, brown, and yellow leaves in an autumn that never ends. Ancient remnants in the form of crumbled arches, obelisks, and standing stones, litter the underbrush and meadows. Even the wooden platforms mounted in the trees, the Elven flets, hint of a world that is slowly vanishing.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> It&#8217;s oddly appropriate because it&#8217;s no longer the early days of the game. The first expansion, the Mines of Moria, was a year too late to prevent the mass migration that set in a year after the game came out, when it became clear that a new expansion wasn&#8217;t coming soon. Worse, the long awaited expansion transparently utilized tedious ways to make the players stay for as long as possible, as if the game&#8217;s publisher suddenly realized they were losing money and had to roll out any method of holding back the players. But they didn&#8217;t succeed. More than half the players that were here in the start have moved on to other games and other worlds. A few of them returned when Mines of Moria came out, fewer still when the subsequent expansion, Mirkwood, followed a year later. Thus, I expect the player numbers to diminish for every orbit of the MMO cycle completed. My own enthusiasm for the game has faded as well, yet places like Lothlórien and its claustrophobically dense, but equally beautiful dark twin, Mirkwood, still retains a pull on me and I&#8217;m not sure when I will leave. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-US">My favorite place in Lórien is the fountain in the center of Caras Galadhon, the city in the area. The fountain sits beneath the giant mallorn tree that holds the flet of Galadriel and Celeborn&#8217;s house, Galadriel looking somewhat like a store mannequin with stiff arms and face, and Celeborn standing in an oddly broad-legged stance, as if his thighs are chafing or he suffers from rickets. The fountain&#8217;s wide pool is a mirror of water on which leaves of all hues are floating on the reflection of the surrounding canopies and lamps in fuzzy bloom effect. In the middle of the fountain is a statue of a swan with its wings outspread as if it just landed on the surface, with water spouting high behind it. The lawn around the pool is also covered with leaves, with a bench in ornate wrought-iron and various flowering bushes. Apart from the half snow-covered and melancholically soundtracked Vale of Thrain in Ered Luin, and the aurora-lit pine forest of Taur Orthon in Forochel, the swan fountain in Caras Galadhon is my favorite place in the whole game. This is where I go when I need to see something beautiful and don&#8217;t have anything else to do, in the game or in my real life. The sight of the leaves floating on the water, the swan, and the soft canopy-sky elicits the feeling of being in a world where magic is still present.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">On the trip with D. we don&#8217;t enter Caras Galadhon. Instead, we cross back and forth in the forest and the circular ridge that surrounds the city while we search for a named bear matron, a deer buck, and a grunting boar which D. knows the locations and routes for. We spot two of them, the bear and the deer, and get one shard each. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen the level 65 shrew?&#8221; D. says.</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> In the text chat I /laugh. &#8220;A level 65 shrew?&#8221; I say. &#8220;Is it named?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; D. says, &#8220;and it has a shard, but the shrew&#8217;s really hard to find. I&#8217;ve only seen it once or twice.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; I say. &#8220;We have to be careful so it doesn&#8217;t kill us.&#8221; I find the idea of a shrew so fierce it can kill low level characters with one attack hilarious. So much so that I&#8217;m thinking of letting the shrew defeat my avatar so I can say he was once killed by it. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> D. leads the way past boulders and bushes, up fern-clad hillocks and across whispering meadows to an abandoned garden with overgrown stone terraces and crumbling gazebos. In the tall grass are angry shrew and wolverines, lynx and wild boar, hawks and bats and owls. We dismount and enter, do the daily quest that requires us to find seven nuts and plant seven seeds in the old garden, while protecting them from the aggressive computer-controlled wildlife. We do the quest and chat together, collect some materials for crafting, while looking for the level 65 shrew.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the shrew called?&#8221; I say, curious to hear what a super strong rodent is named in Middle-Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha ha, I don&#8217;t remember,&#8221; D. says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve only seen it a few times.&#8221;</p>
<p>We search a little more for the shrew, then give up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want me to show you where the nodes for crafting materials are?&#8221; D. says.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need to,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I have another place I go to for materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down in Nud Melek in the basement of Moria. And the Redhorn Lodes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t those full of goblins and worms and shit?&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;Yeah, but they&#8217;re all green and easy to beat,&#8221; I say. &#8220;And I can usually outrun them on the fast goat.&#8221; I&#8217;ve spent many nights down there and think of it as my personal hellhole where I only go when I need money and materials for raiding. Yet, I like watching the feet of my furry giant goat, the only mount allowed inside Moria, go and go while the rest of the animal floats serenely across the ancient paving. &#8220;This place is much better,&#8221; I say. &#8220;Sunnier. But don&#8217;t you get bored of waiting for the materials nodes to pop?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got three or four I cycle between,&#8221; D. says. &#8220;Or I just stand at one of them while chatting with kinnies, or watching TV on the side.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like selling and buying stuff at the auction house?&#8221; I say. Some enjoy it as a game in the game. I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; D. says. &#8220;Got nothing else to do in here these days. Or I craft for the kinnies, so they have potions and scrolls for the raids.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;You&#8217;re too kind,&#8221; I say. People should grind those materials themselves, not just get it handed to them from their kinship officers. Again it&#8217;s time versus progress and how much you are willing to spend in the game on one of them to get the other. But I don&#8217;t say that to D., since he already knows what I think of players who don&#8217;t come properly prepared for the raids.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I got money enough,&#8221; D. says. &#8220;I make a little from scrolls and potions.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> The first players to reach maximum level and craft the first items in the game earned hundreds of gold on it. One woman I heard of had more than 1000 gold pieces, something I couldn&#8217;t imagine earning. Months later, when D. and I are playing another MMO together, he tells me he quit crafting and selling because he reached the maximum limit of money in the Middle-Earth game: 9999 gold.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">In the early fall I finally give in to an impulse I&#8217;ve had since the start of the year. I contact the cat breeder where my family&#8217;s rehomed Burmese cat came from and ask if she knows about any cat who needs a new home. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she mails back, &#8220;but it&#8217;s two cats, they&#8217;re mine and three and five years old.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> I have considered getting two felines, since Burmese cats don&#8217;t like to be alone. And, I suspect, two cats is one hundred percent more cat for only fifty percent more work when I already need to change litter, buy dry food, etc. A few weeks later I visit to meet the two cats. The cat breeder, who breeds several types of cats and dog, serves coffee and chocolate cake. Long white dog hairs stick out of the icing on the cake, like rushes on a frozen pond. The cat breeder recently lost her husband and is still mourning. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> In the sofa in the living room I&#8217;m accosted by a blue Burmese cat that is clearly desperate to get petted. In the hallway a small and sickly looking lilac Burmese cat is meowing and pacing restlessly while she allows me to pet her. When she tries to enter the living room, the dogs that have been placed in a pen there rear up on their hind legs and make a strange hissing sound at her. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve heard dogs hiss. The diminutive cat in the hallway is Chloe, and Dotty, the blue Burmese in the living room, is her daughter. The two cats spend most of the time in their owner&#8217;s bedroom because they are afraid of the dogs. After seeing how the cats live there is no way I can leave them behind.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take both cats,&#8221; I say, to my own and the breeder&#8217;s surprise.</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; the cat breeder says. &#8220;If it doesn&#8217;t work out, I&#8217;d rather have them back than the alternative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I say. &#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">But I know it will work out. My parents&#8217; Burmese cat had behavior problems when she was rehomed to us. But with time and calm surroundings, she shed her nervousness and even her feline hyperesthesia almost vanished, and she became an extraordinarily loving and social cat. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> In the same way as I enter a raid or a boss fight in the game, I bring the two cats home, certain of victory. The cats are very frightened, with Dotty hiding first inside a blanket in the hallway, then behind the washing machine in the bathroom, then under the sofa in the living room, for three days. When I finally manage to coax her out from under the sofa and into my lap, she falls asleep on her own face from exhaustion. From then on my love for the desperately cuddly cat only increases and Dotty quickly bonds with me, despite her initially strong fear. But the small cat, Chloe, remains in the hallway, whimpering and scratching at the door, or running maniacally along the walls of the living room, round after round, like a zoo animal in her cage. I don&#8217;t know how to calm Chloe, but remove her from the door every time she scratches on it, and take her back to the living room so she can see she is welcome to stay there. After a few days of doing this, Chloe settles in the living room with Dotty and me. But she doesn&#8217;t bond to me like Dotty does.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US">After a month I let the cats out on the veranda, thinking that they are now accustomed to their new home and that it&#8217;s safe to let them out. But the moment the cats are outside, they run down into the garden and into the neighbor&#8217;s yard. The day and evening passes. I&#8217;m out on the veranda calling for the cats and scanning the surrounding hedges and lawns for them. Just as I&#8217;m about to return inside and close the door for the night, I hear a meow. It&#8217;s Chloe, looking surprisingly calm and unafraid, and stained with grease and dirt from the neighbor&#8217;s open garage. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> I&#8217;m delighted and relieved to have Chloe back, but where is Dotty? I&#8217;m up several times that night calling for her, hoping she will hear my voice and return like Chloe did. The next day I&#8217;m out in the morning, midday, early afternoon, late afternoon, early evening, late evening, and into the night, calling for Dotty. One day passes, another day, and another day. I&#8217;m out calling for Dotty at all times of the day and night. By now the neighbors must be really sick of me. It&#8217;s the middle of October and not freezing yet, but gale winds and icy rain hint of what&#8217;s to come. I regret bitterly that I let the cats out in the first place and wonder if Dotty is still alive. At night I think I hear a cat meowing, but every time I open the door there is nothing, no Dotty, and it must have been another feline. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> My sister comes over and we search the neighboring yards and garages. In one garden we find a shed filled with musty furniture and pillows. I think we may be in the right place, but we see no eyes shining between the cushions, no trembling whiskers. I hang up posters of Dotty on streetlights and in the grocery stores in the neighborhood with a promise of monetary reward for getting her back. But while Dotty is missing, Chloe starts bonding to me like Dotty has.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> After a few days I place a bowl of cat food right outside the door to tempt any cat roaming the neighborhood to come and eat, so I can at least see if the feline I hear meowing each night is Dotty or not. Two nights later I hear the bowl being pushed against the door from someone eating. I run outside. A gray, medium-sized cat is staring up at the veranda, clearly having fled from it. I run after the cat, but she flees into the darkness. It&#8217;s Dotty. </span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;How am I ever going to get Dotty inside?&#8221; I ask D. He&#8217;s a cat owner too, and has shared stories of his large and formerly feral tomcat who now rules the house. &#8220;She runs off when I try to catch her. Even if I place the food in the hallway and that lures her inside, how will I get past her to close the door?&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tie a string around the door handle,&#8221; D. says. &#8220;That way you can pull the door shut behind her when she comes inside to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> The next night I do as advised, loop a thick string around the door handle, roll the length out, and hunch behind the sofa, lights off. I&#8217;m in my winter jacket and gloves and shoes, because even with the door just ajar, October is blustering into the living room. After a long and cold wait, late in the evening a familiar shadow slinks through the door and heads for the bowl of food placed well inside. I pull the string and hold it tight so the door doesn&#8217;t bounce open. Dotty jumps nearly a meter into the air and heads for the door, but it&#8217;s now pushed close behind her. I rush up and shut and lock the door. Dotty runs and hides under a table in the living room. But as soon as she has sniffed my hand, she comes out from hiding and jumps up into my lap. No longer blinded by panic, she&#8217;s finally accessing her memory map of this place, her home, and lets me pet her while she purrs loudly.</span></p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> &#8220;Without you I might never have gotten Dotty back,&#8221; I tell D. the next night. Dotty is safely in my lap and has drunk plenty of water and eaten well, and shows surprisingly few signs of having spent several days outside. From then on Dotty only goes out for short trips on the veranda and hardly leaves my side. With calm surroundings and time she and Chloe become highly social and loving cats.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I quit the game, I stay in touch with D. I write a book and he wants to read it, so I send him a signed copy. In the early summer we play another MMO together while he&#8217;s refurbishing the house of his brother who got a job abroad. As it turns out there&#8217;s a lot more to do than expected, the work is slow, and his mother&#8217;s health has deteriorated.</p>
<p lang="nb-NO"><span lang="en-US"> In the fall D. says he has to dedicate all his time to the house, and that he&#8217;s all but quit the game. I don&#8217;t hear from him after that, despite sending several mails and postcards. A year later I log into the game to see if he&#8217;s still there or if D.&#8217;s kinship leader or fellow officers have heard from him. After a few weeks the leader finally logs on and I ask him if he&#8217;s spoken with D., but no one has heard from him for over a year. I&#8217;m the person who played with him last. Maybe D.&#8217;s mother died and he moved to his siblings? Or he sold the house and found new work in another city? I consider getting someone to track D. down to give him a letter, but decide against it. Perhaps he doesn&#8217;t want to be in touch? Maybe he&#8217;s started a new life and doesn&#8217;t want to be pulled back in the game? That is a possibility and I must accept it. I still don&#8217;t know what happened to D.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Moria</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I say about this place? Only that it took years of my life. More time than the days and weeks and months I actually spent there. Years of effort, years of energy. When I finally knew my way around the maps, the tunnels, treasuries, mines, caves, could spell the name Anazârmekhem without hesitating, and fight through the Foundations of Stone without getting lost, even to the remains of the Bridge of Khazad-Dûm, I had spent far too much time there, longer than the rest of the game combined. I cannot speak of it much. Like its tunnels, Moria is too serpentine, too dense, too dark. I have nothing good to say about that place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gone for Good</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I return to the game several times, with varying success and length. Even when all I do is ride back and forth between the places I remember and want to see again, preserved forever in the non-decaying but increasingly lonely state of an abandoned virtual world, the period I stay becomes shorter and shorter and the interval between each return wider and wider, until I no longer feel like logging into the game, not even to look for the last few friends I know are still playing.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when I know I have quit the game for good. Its landscapes and players, the many impressions they left in me, have been replaced by other, more recent and more relevant-seeming yearnings. I have finally become another place.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Or Destroying)</p>
<p><b>New York City </b></p>
<p>Travelling south from the jungle twin cities of Boston and Philadelphia, a long trade road dominated by horse and camel hooked east, cutting through two mountain passes, and reached this little desert fortress given the name of New York City. The sand was not flat, the white grains just a thin cover over skyscraping rock. Almost nothing grew, the city relying on a lake and a paltry acre of a river. Grain was imported to its granary and water mill so that it could remotely feed itself. There was the strong suspicion that under those hills, in a thousand years or so, there would be coal, oil, aluminum, or uranium, something to make the spot worth it, but right then, there was nothing but sand and rock. The city scraped by at underpopulated weight, investing in the highest possible walls and the only castle in the empire. No grand wonders or temples. No libraries and no workshops. Just a barracks and a wall sunk in the dirt. Building those alone took decades. New Yorkers were constantly unhappy, on the verge of revolt, kept in check by men holding pikes. Every fifteen years Egyptian armies came streaming through the mountains and attempted to bring down the walls. Little chariots, horsemen, swordsmen, and catapults, all bearing that little yellow and purple flag, would converge on little starving blue New York. And each time, it would somehow survive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Alexandria</b></p>
<p>The Senate told me they wanted Alexandria. It was one of the last objectives. I sent a single legion from Sicily across the Mediterranean, removing the cloud that had concealed it. I landed, but found that Alexandria was not a city, but <i>the</i> city. This, not Rome, was the center of the world. It had the most advanced buildings I had seen, the largest population, overflowing far past the point of my single army being able to take it. It took eight, eight armies, thrown at the same time, to take out the city and its defenses. Even in the battle map, the city was a bright silver monster. It was beautiful, white walls looping to the ocean, The Lighthouse and The Library. I tried to take it intact, occupy the thing without needless destruction or plunder, but then of course, the next turn, the population pressure and unrest was so immense that I was immediately overthrown, and a new flag rose over its battlements and its multitudes. We climbed the walls again, this time taking advantage in the damage they had already suffered, and sacked the city, burning its plazas, its gardens, its forums. I took the greatest city in the world, and worse than destroying it completely, I made it mediocre. I made it nothing. No matter how hard I tried for the rest of time, I couldn’t get Alexandria to what it had been. The numbers would not climb that high. The machine would not let me accomplish what it had. And every other time I played the game, the machine never accomplished it either, never grew it that big. Alexandria never became that Alexandria again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxopolis </b></p>
<p>Steel, granite, and glass reached for the heavens along a long curved peninsula, true downtown lying on a raised plateau overlooking a tropical bay, causing the blue and green and brown buildings to extend higher. Suburban sprawl, fields of factories, spiraled out from the dense center, bedroom communities and farming towns. I sculpted the roads in continual circles, imitating the terrain, a whole city of roundabouts and weird arcs. In the center of the bay, I placed an airport on the island, and its runways sat straight relative to all the other curves, the only semblance of a true grid. Parks lined the beaches. The lights reflected off of the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>London</b></p>
<p>Every natural resource lay naturally within London&#8217;s borders, as if placed by a divine intelligently designing being, which of course, is exactly what had happened. London was playing on an unequal playing field from the start. The stats were juked by geography.</p>
<p>Within the walls, it looked like a twisted version of Vegas. The Pyramids, then the Colossus, then the Hanging Gardens, The Great Wall, The Sistine Chapel, The Hoover Dam, all in a nice little line in the same space. A sentried carrier battle group sat around the island, not even really needing to protect it with the scales of the universe so tipped, the little grey ships an aesthetic accompaniment to the world wonder theme park. The places I am building are not real, I thought. They are chesspieces or block toys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Morgan Industries/Gaia’s Landing </b></p>
<p>Energy collection around Morgan Industries was pushed to its furthest possible extreme. The very elevation of the ground had been raised by terraforming, bringing the solar collectors and echelon mirrors closer to the solar radiation raining down from above. Every form of bank or power generation or resource exploitation was built without concern for environment or cost. Blue magtubes linked it in network with all the other bases of industry, terrain dominated by thermal boreholes and strip mines, only interrupted by the explosions of red and pink fungus, the planet fighting back. It was a city literally trying to buy the world. That was its goal. Buy the world. The whole world. Trade and bargain and short and long and one day take the whole market for yourself.</p>
<p>Across the bay, Gaia’s Landing was surrounded by forest, this shade of pine forming an ocean around its lime and brown core. The same mag tube lines were the only thing interrupting the vegetation. Gaia’s Landing was in perfect symbiosis with its environment, or, I should say, with its human environment. The truth is, if there was an objective truth in that world, the forests were just as much alien invaders as Morgan’s mines. Both were interlopers.</p>
<p>Gaia’s Landing and Morgan Industries were not grown or made under my control. It was the AI behaving in perfect narrative cohesion. Two cities, actually following what the game’s text said they were trying to do, to the letter, ignoring the actual strategic math of their decisions. They built certain improvements for ideology’s sake. They were actors in a play.</p>
<p>And so I played my role, and I did not conquer them. I let them attack the planet in their ways.</p>
<p>I couldn’t play the game much more than that, because with enough knowledge, it became chess. It wasn’t about the stories anymore, even the stories in your head. The minerals and resources were playthings. Ways to win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Londinium</b></p>
<p>Londinium was a maze. Roads, which felt more like paths, danced around square red-roofed buildings before dead ending in fountains or gardens. Figuring out a true path through the city was impossible. The construction of a single grand villa unknowingly severed the main thoroughfare out of the city, and caused the need for a bypass that zigzagged through several temples. Clay pits and pottery shops clung to the river, the smoke from kilns rising each day. The Thames fed reservoirs, aqueducts, and baths. Technicolor plazas ringed the brick apartments and houses. Theaters and schools released their crowds onto the streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The Metal Isles</b></p>
<p>The Metal Isles were not meant for a city. They were meant as a battlefield. No living things were there anyway. There were four islands, one in each corner, rectangles that were almost squares, each with a system of pre-built walls which loomed within their interior, all made out of an unending synthenic metal. The game was to defeat your opponent, your robots against theirs. But instead, I built. I built metal and solar collectors, endless lines of turrets and platforms, shipyards and airbases, massive fusion reactors. At a certain point, the base became a city. Eventually my radar extended out to see my opponent across the sea on their own isle. They had built their own city, swarmed over by a shifting cloud of units, flying in circles, unsure whether to assault the citadel I had laid out for them. The enemy did not know what to do. It hit the unit limit, and waited, the clouds on the radar screen never repeating the same pattern twice. And my drones ignored them, and kept building. My little robots tried to make my island perfectly symmetrical. Tried to make everything fit. And winning did not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Mentar III </b></p>
<p>Mentar III was a planet, but also a city. I remember looking down on it from space above, seeing every possible building built, every derivation, over its green utopian Gaian-class surface. The technoecological paradise, I remember that green. Whenever I see that particular shade of emerald pop-up in my life, I think, Gaian-class Green. I remember that Mentar III the planet that was also a city was defended by a horde of spaceships that were also almost planets, and also cities. And that I had my own horde of city spaceships, carefully designed and planned as if they were cities, as if they had to eat, and educate, and grow. I remember that Mentar III was the last planet left. The last that was not mine. I remember having to automate the battle because it was too big. I remember the invasion having marines that filled up the screen, little suits up against mechs and men, once again against that shade and against those buildings, or those that had survived the bombardment. Or maybe I’m remembering wrong and I didn’t invade. Maybe I simply bombed it from orbit until nothing was left. Maybe I incinerated the planet itself. Maybe I felt sad about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fort Orange</b></p>
<p>The site of Isabella was stolen from the nearby Arawaks by the Spanish Conquistadors. Straight theft, followed up by conquest and plunder. I then stole it from the Spanish. Liberation was not an option. The Spanish had cut down all the trees around Isabella, and there was no terrain suitable for mining, so lumber and ore had to be imported on wagon trades. Professions inside the city had to be carefully micromanaged, turning the carpenter into a preacher or a statesman and then back into a carpenter. It exported sugar. I kept wrestling with whether I actually wanted it or not, considered leaving it undefended in the hopes that someone might take it away, take it back. There was no way to actually destroy it. So it sat. Fortress and all. My city of guilt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxstan III</b></p>
<p>It might have been the hundredth city to bear the name of Maxstan. For this one, 80% of the surrounding map was insane fractal mountains, carved from the map editor to resemble the heights of a vengeful god, a treeless organism of dull brown jagged heights. The tool would grab mountains out of a flat plane, raising the dirt and ridges into the sky. Then random cascades of water caved into the center, tributaries flowing both up and down in ways that defied reasonable physics. Two waterfalls fell off of both sides of the tallest peak, without an obvious source for the water’s origin. They were like aqua volcanoes. The city tapped them for power, little grey dams reaching up the valley walls, residential neighborhoods squeezed into every flat space available. I was able to get it up to 12,000 people, roads clinging to the edges and crests to connect the little mesas of industrial zones or office parks. In the center of the map, the center of the city, every possible municipal headquarters was crammed onto a plateau, parks and police stations and city hall sharing the space with almost no room for embellishment.</p>
<p>Then one day, with land and population and tax revenue maxed out, Maxstan fell. The seals opened one by one. A new set of plagues. First, fire. The blaze climbed the summits and bit the little structures, leaving rubble and choking the city. Then the water came too, flooding from all angles. Then the planes fell out of the sky, the winds rose and a tornado carved the city center into nothing. The earth shook, and the rains came, and then the four armed, red-eyed monster descended from above, and snuffed Maxstan into nothing, the abandoned buildings of the fleeing citizens blinking from not having any power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxstan II </b></p>
<p>It was probably not the second Maxstan, more like the twentieth. It had a long lake down the center, the shore of which I had absolutely saturated with water pumps. Maxstan was the most watered city in the world, galactic capital of plumbing. I liked the little animation of the water pumping, the ropes of light going dark blue and then light. I built boulevards around the water, avenues to the god of the fluid, blue gold. The whole city emanating from that shining, pumping core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Maxstan I</b></p>
<p>The only thing I remember is that the natural gas powerplant blew up because it was too old, and I didn’t have the money to replace it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Athens </b></p>
<p>The little island protected Athens from my rivals. It was the approximate size of, say, Iceland, at that sort of scale, a green interior surrounded by mountains along the coast. Athens lay at the bottom, where the river met the shoreline. I had played the game dozens of times, thinking that it was merely a simulation of ancient times. I had always played as the Greeks, always started with little Athens, and never got much further than building a temple and a barracks and cranking out a few militia and founding Sparta and Delphi. But this one time, on that island, Athens was destined to be more. I remember the feeling of discovering gunpowder, of building a bank, an aqueduct, a coliseum. Of wondering, how far does this go? And not actually knowing the answer. I remember first discovering that the island was an island, my horseman scouting those last hills, understanding that my three cities would be unthreatened from Stalin or Gandhi, that it was just building from here.</p>
<p>By the end, you could look at Athens from the hill, the first city I remember building, looking more like a midwestern town than a megacity, a collection of repeated non-descript red and blue pixelated buildings only interrupted by a Cathedral or the towering rocket of the Apollo program. It was not clear to me then if I was actually building the city or if the game was. What my decisions meant for the place, as much as it was a place. Or where exactly the place existed, other than my head. I don’t know what happened to Athens. I don’t remember.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="western">It was the summer of 2005 that my brothers and I spent in Noopy, our <i>Animal Crossing </i>town. I had only just moved in—one room, a simple bed, in debt to Noopy’s raccoon proprietor, Tom Nook—when Mom and I had to drive up to the band room in the middle of the night to make sure it was unlocked for the drum corps. The night air was hot and we waited in the car for the tour buses to get in. In Noopy I fished and caught bugs at night, listening to changes in the music with the chime of each new hour. The insect room of the Noopy museum sounded like a Louisiana summer night. When the Bluecoats finally pulled up, they split—the corps took the floor of the gym; the bus drivers slept in practice rooms.</p>
<p class="western">We didn’t know much about drum corps then, other than what we’d watched on the big screen in the band room, but I at least knew about sleeping on tour buses and wondered how the corps members ever got any rest. For a day we were in and out of the house, so tired and so confused as we switched between the bright daylight and fluorescent lights as the professional marching band stretched in the band room, marched the same drill back and forth, lined up for lunch at the food truck—and alternately, the dark upstairs bedroom (I closed my blinds and pulled down the shade) with, just across the hallway, the yellow light of my brothers’ room and the characters who were running around doing errands for neighbors or hitting neighbors on the heads with their bug-catching nets. My brothers had gotten a full night’s rest, and Liesl—that was what I’d named my Noopy-self—slept all hours of the night and day: when I was ready to leave her world, I’d walk her up the stairs to rest. I couldn’t mimic her schedule in the real world; soon enough the noise from my brothers’ room or the dog downstairs was enough to rouse me from my bed.</p>
<p class="western">That was the summer I was learning how to operate a motor vehicle in the most backwards way—Driver’s Ed tests took place on roads, not in parking lots, even if we’d never driven before. It was simpler in Noopy—no cars, just running shoes, plus the occasional bus or boat. Unlike the unfamiliar neighborhoods I had to traverse in my Driver’s Ed car, the Noopy landmarks were straightforward and easy to map: Tom Nook’s place. Able Sisters. The town hall. The dump. The museum. Neighbors’ houses, the river, the bridges, the cliff, the sea. My mother had to drive me back and forth up to the band room already that summer because I was a newly-appointed drum major. She probably didn’t appreciate that I had volunteered us for the drum corps thing on top of the Driver’s Ed thing. Mostly my brothers protested because they couldn’t be at home exploring Noopy, competing to see who could pay off their house loans first.</p>
<p class="western">At the drum corps show, we learned that cheering for the Bluecoats sounded like booing—“<i>Bluuuuuue!</i>”—and in the evening light the Carolina Crown color guard raised giant white flags like wings. That was the summer the Boston Crusaders played “Ode to Joy.” That was the summer Jason Cameron died. My brothers and I traded off time in Noopy every second we could get: the soft pat of our footsteps in digital midday sun was preferable to sandals on hot concrete, the air conditioning to our hometown heat and humidity. We wrote gibberish letters to leave in each other’s mailboxes, checked up constantly on our virtual neighbors. In the basement coffee shop where K. K. Slider placidly “oh-wee-oh-way-way”-ed us Saturday nights we could almost forget how the sixteen-year-old trombone section leader had died in a car wreck on the interstate. As I spun Liesl around, slingshot in hand, searching for that red-balloon surprise gift in the Noopy sky I could almost forget the phone call that came as I stood drying dishes, how my mother walked away to take it, how she came back: I was so shocked I forgot the word for “trombone.” As I hoped for the millionth time that the oblong shadow tugging on my fishing line was anything <i>but</i> a Sea Bass, I could almost wipe from my mind the image of Jason’s best friends—all upperclassmen, all seniors—when I saw them at the funeral. The video that played on the projector screens. The cheap, waxy rosary that snapped accidentally in my hands. The open casket. I took Liesl to the Able Sisters and painstakingly doodled a design for an umbrella. I bought impossible chests of drawers to store my extra wallpapers, my gyroids, my furniture that looked like fruit. I was terrified of driving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you have to earn the horse, like a weapon or a boat or an airship. You acquire it by completing a fetch quest for a cranky farmer, or jacking a horse out from under some random villager. You are not punished for this because you are saving the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes the horse is not a horse at all, but a fluffy yellow Chocobo or a bog unicorn or a color-changing dinosaur with a fruit addiction and a prehensile tongue.</p>
<p>Sometimes the horse comes with a name, like Roach or Shadowmere or Epona. When you choose its name, it gets called Shitstain or Ianto Pones or Twinkletoes Shoeboffin. But even these are powerful names, bellowed loud and long in cavernous Downy-scented basements and dank dorm rooms and basement dorm rooms whenever your digital Secretariat comes through in the clutch, helping to outrun a grizzly or shoot a bandit or fire a fatal acid arrow into the red flashing heart of a boss.</p>
<p>Sometimes your horse pulls a covered wagon that, clown-car like, manages to house a Zenithian celestial with giant angel wings, a fire-breathing dinosaur, a fortuneteller, an exotic dancer, a traveling merchant, a tomboy princess and her retainers, a purple-clad knight, and the green-haired Chosen One (that’s you!), along with an impressive assortment of weapons, armor, and medicinal herbs. All party members collect experience as normal whenever the wagon is present, which means you imagine them sitting in there playing cards or jabbing their swords at brass rings or whatever as the four active party members march alongside the wagon.</p>
<p>Acquiring the horse and wagon lets you swap out unconscious party members during a boss fight—an essential feature during the endgame. But your B-team is always under-leveled, no matter how much you grind. It turns out playing solitaire in a covered wagon isn’t roughly equivalent to crushing Metal Slimes in your bare hands.</p>
<p>Sometimes the horse is treated like a mere item, an inert possession unceremoniously shoved into a bottomless knapsack or sold into forgotten oblivion at any random item shop, regardless of whether accommodations for livestock are visible in the village.</p>
<p>Sometimes the horse is able to scale mountains all by itself, glitching through hiccupping sky, phasing through terrain and enemies, an equine Kitty Pryde.</p>
<p>Sometimes party members disappear whenever you mount, since there’s only one horse for all ten of you. Despite the fundamental and glaring philosophical, racial, and socioeconomic differences highlighted in every conversation between your allies, all of them are apparently content to ride cozily absorbed into your breastplate. But this arrangement understandably ends party banter, so you dismount. Soon you forget the Inquisition even recruited Horseman Dennet, even though every NPC you met made his involvement seem crucial to your success at the time—like you’d all ride around the countryside together, because the overworld maps were so huge you’d need horses, but they weren’t.</p>
<p>Sometimes the horse is an enemy called a NiteMare or a MadPony or Unicorn, and it travels in herds, grazing in the mossy cracks of ruined dungeons and castles until attracted to the torches of unsuspecting Warriors of Light. The equine enemy family is not particularly difficult to kill, but annoyingly summons more of itself whenever the chips are down.</p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a> Sometimes the name of a scrappy black pony is the lone word remaining to the last man on Earth, where life is an endless gallop across an uninhabited and vaguely Celtic plain, studded with insurmountable crags. The motive behind your relentless orienteering and ritual slaughter of sixteen ancient and blameless colossi remains unclear, as does your relationship to the unconscious princess you are compelled to save through sheer force of fairytale. There are no other beings here, nary a bird or butterfly. Panic sets in. “Agro?” you implore, then shout, then cry, pressing X again and again, just to hear a human voice.</p>
<p>The horse is already standing beside you.</p>
