								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At dusk they moved through a landscape littered
with megafauna skeletons. Sand polished the bones and sifted into every crevice
on their bodies—between eyebrow hairs, into ear whorls, within clothing
creases. Huge jaws half-sunk in sand snapped at random, mandibles interlaced on
the squeak of something living, though neither of them saw anything move over
the tall dunes except tarantula-sized crickets which fell into holes at their
approach. Clumps of grass and scrubby bushes waited for the rains to bloom.</p>



<p>When they left the oasis that morning, others
walked alongside them, canteens sloshing against their legs, clear voices
singing harmonies. As the hours passed, the footprints faded. Most travelers
circumnavigated the dunes. He argued that traveling the mountain pass would add
weeks to their journey, and he wanted to cross the river to the valley town
before the river swelled with spring rain. With reluctance, they agreed. After
all, they told themself, getting a choice spot at the craft market would increase
sales of the hand-spun yarn and whittled dolls they carried. When he knew he
was going to get his way, he leaned in, held their arm, told them that in the
desert&#8217;s largest ribcage he would transform the cave jewel into the most
powerful sword in the realm. They wanted to believe him, but they were used to
the glass castles of his stories. </p>



<p>They pressed onward, toward the highest dune.
Wind formed ripples on the ridges which they destroyed with every step. When
they miscalculated trajectories of least resistance, the west-fading sand
scalded their palms. Tiny black beetles, barely larger than the sand
themselves, flailed in the avalanches created when they rested. They imagined
themself like the beetles trying to skate through the unforeseen. He kept turning
back to look at them. They tried to breathe against convulsing lungs, gave the
thumbs-up sign, and drank some water, hoping that if they pretended everything
was okay, it would be. Sand stuck in the dry cracks at the corners of their
lips. </p>



<p>They climbed the flanks of the Star Dune and
stood at its peak. On high, they noted landmarks on the map. The horizon hinted
at the valley. Below them, vertebrae the size of tires rested in a line. Dark
shapes floated across the sky, mirrored over the earth. In the distance,
thunder rumbled, and the breeze turned violent. They belly-crawled to avoid
lightning. When the gap between rumbles and flashes quickened, they curled up
on their packs. </p>



<p>Together they sheltered in the ribcage, the one
they meant to find, each rib big around as a cathedral column and casting
unearthly shadows. They sat with their backs against the largest rib and
covered their heads with fabric until the sand died down. He grinned and took
the prismatic shard from his pack. They loved his grin. Holding it, he walked
into the center of the ribcage, where it shape-shifted into an enormous purple
sword. In his excitement, he swung it, spinning and feinting, deep in battle
with an imaginary foe. They hugged their chin to their knees and watched. </p>



<p>As he spun, he mistimed and smashed the sword
into a rib. It stuck. They took turns pushing and pulling with combined weight.
No luck. Long after night fell, they hung their tentcloth from the blade, tying
the cloth edges to the other ribs. In sleep, they faced each other, their
foreheads, knees, and feet touching, packs under their heads. Sandy breeze
weighed down the cloth they wrapped around themselves. </p>



<p>All night they dreamed of escape from the belly of a cyclopean beast. He was there, too, his impish eyes above the edge of his scarf, mashing his feet into the muck as though stomping grapes. Their feet stuck in a churning mass of half-masticated flesh and meteoric stoats. Acidic moisture condensed on the walls of skin. When they tried to climb out, they gained purchase only to slip and crash. In dreamtime they melted into skeletons still trapped.</p>



<p>When the two of them woke, it was to vulture screeches and the sound of tiny bones clinking through a grate. In the night the towers migrated. Gathering dew from the tentcloth, they poured it into a bottle. In the light, the sword looked smaller than before. Onward they trekked, toward the town on the other side of the desert. They made a pact to not look back at the sword. On the next rise, he broke it. </p>

<p><strong>ENTERTAINMENT | GAMING</strong></p>



<p>An
immersive, disturbing escape from unreality</p>



<p>By TED
ZACHARIAS</p>



<p>Friday,
November 7, 2031, 4:48:50 PM EST</p>



<p>ALBATROSS</p>



<p>Developer
and Publisher: Slipstream Games, Inc.</p>



<p><em>[Mr. Zacharias, who has returned to Stanford University to pursue
a master’s degree in computer science, sold the video game rights to the story
of his imprisonment in the Labyrinth to Slipstream three years ago. He served
as a fact-checker but was otherwise uninvolved in game development. He declined
compensation for this article. —Ed.] </em></p>



<p>On March 21, 1963, the infamous prison Alcatraz was permanently shuttered. Located in San Francisco Bay, the desolate island fortress has become an immensely popular destination for millions of tourists.</p>



<p>As it
turned out, Alcatraz was only the beginning. A top-secret directive from the
Nixon administration led to the formation of the supermax penitentiary Labyrinth,
the direct successor to Alcatraz, deep underneath Siberia, a tiny ghost town in
the Californian Mojave Desert. In 2025, after a 7.2-magnitude earthquake
shattered the facility, I managed to escape and tell my story to the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>.</p>



<p>My imprisonment
served as the basis for <em>Albatross</em>, a first-person,
total immersion (TI) exploratory game. The starting point is a familiar one for
TI fans, a cold, tiny cell with blinding fluorescent lights, accompanied by the
clank of an unappetizing-looking tray of microwaved food spat out through a
slot in a wall. I had been incarcerated in 24/7 solitary confinement for
approximately two years at this point, with an hour a week allowed for exercise
in a common room with other prisoners. Disorientation was the norm.</p>



<p>There are
no visible guards – the environment is monitored electronically through dozens
of cameras hidden behind small black domes. The only doors leading outside are
sealed shut, without even a keypad or visible lock. It’s otherwise quiet for
the first twenty to thirty minutes, giving you an opportunity to interact with
five other inmates in your area.</p>



<p>Then
suddenly, everything goes sideways. Within seconds, all of you are being
jostled around like laundry in a dryer, all while the PA system calmly instructs
everyone to return to their rooms. Lights flicker, a fiery explosion goes off, and
you black out. You wake up (again) to the wail of alarms and the harsh fumes of
electrical fires. Your fellow inmates are dead. But now, you see a pathway out.</p>



<p>Obviously, escape is your first priority. I played through the game twice, and I can say that there is a degree of randomness to the collapsing ceilings, the out-of-control fires, the presence of obstructing piles of debris, and other environmental obstacles, making each playthrough fresh.. The drones and other electronic surveillance programs pervasive in the lower floors exhibit occasional variability in behaviors, presenting dangerous, dynamic challenges. Considering that the best “weapon” you’ll find for most of the game is a rock or piece of pipe, avoiding surveillance is paramount. Taking damage is about as realistic as a game can get: no health bar or hitpoints, and your field of vision darkening, reddening, or blurring, or your haptic suit’s responsiveness declining with sufficient damage. Just a few scattered items are available to regain health or address injuries, and these take valuable in-game time to use, highlighting how <em>Albatross</em> is supposed to be played: carefully, stealthily, and efficiently.</p>



<p>From
groundbreaking in 1972 through the next half-century, the mission of the Labyrinth
evolved as successive presidential administrations assumed control and stamped
their identity on the complex. Entire wings, along with their supporting
infrastructure, sprouted like roots. The newest areas, where you begin your
travels, are deep underground and furthest away from Siberia, but also the most
high-tech. In one of the more unusual early sequences, you’ll enter a zone of
automatically moving containment rooms and hallways that fit together like a
3-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, haphazardly operated by a now-malfunctioning virtual
intelligence system. Unable to bypass this completely, you’re forced to either
identify a pattern in the building’s movements and time your own actions
accordingly, or find a method of suspending the superstructure in place.</p>



<p>Yes, this
was a real location.</p>



<p>As you
ascend, the environment and technology regress, reflecting the earlier eras in
which they were developed. In contrast to the space-age whites, grays, and
blues of the lower levels, the upper floors have a more retro look, from the
ugly orange and brown décor to the clunky-looking computer mainframes and
monitors crammed into too-small offices. Electronic deadbolts are replaced by unadorned
keyholes, combination locks, and heavy safe-like doors more fitting for a
classical Old World bank. Patrol drones and robots are exchanged for a
veritable army of armed guards and ancillary staff. Fortunately for you, most
of the guards are themselves eager to escape the facility, and sometimes a
disguise is all that’s needed to avoid their attention.</p>



<p>Having
been abducted by the US government to a heretofore unknown rendition site on
American soil was preposterous on its face. I became a credible witness due to
having brought a substantial amount of information with me during my escape. <em>Albatross</em> provides numerous ways to
accrue evidence: photographs, video/audio recordings, paper documentation,
computer drives, and more are scattered across more than 100 floors, turning
you into an investigative reporter of sorts. You’ll have to find a way to
gather the evidence, all while trying to escape, and in RPG-like fashion, your
inventory capacity has limits.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game doesn’t quantify the credibility or value of the information you carry, so you’ll have to make an educated guess as to whether it’s enough. (Slipstream says there is an internal formula for gaming purposes.) But suffice it to say that practically anything that made it into the public record, including actual declassified congressional hearings and on-the-record media interviews given by me and others who eventually came forward, is available in some format in <em>Albatross</em>. Labyrinthine activities yielded everything from DARPA’s Omnibus computer network intelligence, the successor to the “Combat Zones that See” initiative, to Operation Calm State, the domestic black-ops program sponsored by the Department of Defense and the one responsible for my imprisonment. Brush off your civics lessons: watching news programming and US history channels may well help you complete this grim task.</p>



<p>Slipstream
has advised that there’s a play timer, invisible to the player. Although
several endings are possible, based on how long it takes to escape and what you
bring with you, failure to escape before running out of allotted time always
leads to the undesirable one. Think of it this way: news of the prison break
will eventually find its way to federal authorities, who seek to cover up the
disaster by any means necessary. You’re not going to survive being swarmed by
highly-trained, masked soldiers wielding automatic weapons and explosives, or in
a truly over-the-top scenario, a tactical nuclear explosion.</p>



<p>Although <em>Albatross</em> can be run on a basic home
computer setup, the game deserves to be experienced with a VR headset, haptic
feedback suit, and a 360-degree motion detector rig. You’ll sense the chill air
of your prison, the sting and burning odor of lasers on flesh, the scorching
heat of fires, the blunt impact of falling or thrown objects, and even the
weight of your inventory. You’ll also be able to hear PA announcements,
short-range radio transmissions, and other noises in your immediate
environment.</p>



<p><em>Albatross</em> utilizes sophisticated,
deep-learning chatbot algorithms, allowing you to hold realistic conversations
with any human character in the game. (Easter egg alert: talk to the right
person in-game and you’ll learn how the game got its namesake.) Conversations
are a blend of preprogrammed scripts and spontaneity, but don’t abuse the
system too much – in other words, avoid excessive swearing or nonsensical
speech – or other characters will ignore you or even become hostile. It’s also
worth noting that Slipstream’s reputation for programming realistic human-based
NPCs remains stellar. The characters of <em>Albatross</em>
are authentic not only in behavior and speech but also appearance. Everything
from facial animations to physical movements are fluid and humanoid, generally
successful at avoiding “uncanny valley” problems that often plague TI games. I
didn’t experience any significant graphical, auditory, and other programming
glitches, even with over a dozen active characters in my sensory field.</p>



<p>For those
seeking a thrilling FPS experience, <em>Albatross</em>
isn’t for you. You’re quite literally outgunned for nearly the entire trek, as
I was, and Slipstream has hinted that excessive violence on the player’s part
will negatively impact the ending. That being said, should you choose to fight
head-on, enemy behavior programming in <em>Albatross</em>
ranks among the best in the current crop of first-person TI games, even
providing ample opportunity for in-game evolution based on your own tactics.
Prison guards and later, military units are alerted to your presence through
sight and sound – both of which also can be used for some effective
misdirection. They’ll utilize a variety of methods to hunt you down, including ambushes,
sniping from well-hidden alcoves, and liberal use of frag and gas grenades to
flush you from cover, all while coordinating their squad movements via radio.
If you happen to pick up a suitable firearm and have good marksmanship, the
enemy will even perform tactical retreats and call for reinforcements.</p>



<p>In
general, <em>Albatross</em> encourages less
combat-oriented interactions with other characters. Conversing with other
people, particularly prisoners, is an integral part of the early and middle
game. While most prison staff will attack you on sight, encounters with other inmates
provide more fodder for tactical decision-making. If they ask or you convince
them to join you, will they speed you up or slow you down? Will it be harder to
sneak around undetected? Most importantly, can they be trusted? Sometimes prisoners
can provide valuable clues during conversation, such as where to go next. Other
times, they may simply stab you in the back. Remember that your weaponry is
limited and melee damage output is rather weak, so getting into a scrape with
fellow detainees poses substantial risks.</p>



<p>Is there
replay value? Absolutely. Seeing the colossal facility in a single playthrough is
practically impossible. I obviously didn’t see the entire Labyrinth during my
time there; Slipstream took artistic liberties with the environment based on
electronic blueprints and photographs that I provided to the authorities. The
developer randomized select areas of the Labyrinth, as well as the location of
many of the items, characters, and evidence. Whether this means that every playthrough
attempt is “winnable” is unclear.</p>



<p>Some have
asked me if it’s too soon to be monetizing the story of my incarceration in the
Labyrinth. The facility itself was designated a National Historic Landmark only
last year. Jordan Johnston, the founder of Slipstream, received enormous flak
when the first preview of <em>Albatross</em>
appeared at the E3 Expo two years ago, even facing down (successfully) a
defamation lawsuit from the estates of two former US Cabinet members who
committed suicide during the Labyrinth hearings. The game also doesn’t acknowledge
what brought me to the attention of the federal government in the first place –
accusations, now disproven, that I led a so-called hacktivist group responsible
for breaking into classified networks run by the Departments of Defense and
State.</p>



<p>But judgment
isn’t what <em>Albatross</em> is about. What
the game does instead is successfully fictionalizes a landmark event in modern
American history, turning it into a dark yet necessary exploration of a
shameful past.</p>



<p>SCORE:
4.5 / 5</p>



<p>Positives:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Story closely mimics actual, publicly known events and does reasonable job of not glamorizing controversy</p><p>Game endings favor non-violent, stealthy, exploratory play</p><p>Hyper-realistic character models, visuals, sounds, and game environment and physics</p><p>Cutting-edge NPC and enemy behaviors</p><p>Multiple aspects of game are randomized, allowing for unique experience with each playthrough</p></blockquote>



<p>Negatives:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Somewhat short: single playthrough can be completed in 4-6 hours</p><p>Source material may be too disturbingly real-life for many players; not suited for children under 18 years of age</p><p>Requires very high-performance gaming rig for full immersion </p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One
day your daughter stops growing up. You notice right away. Her fingernails are
the same exact length that they were yesterday. You count her eyelashes, you
count the freckles on her cheeks, you count her teeth. All the same. She is two
years old.</p>



<p>When you were pregnant, other mothers would tell you that the baby stage was the best. You and your child, raw together in a bright, new world. They told you to savor those moments, that you’d miss them once they’d passed. But even after she was born, you couldn’t wait for your baby to grow up. You ached for the day when she’d be old enough to speak. Old enough for you to teach her things. Like how to catch a Woodskip in the secret woods, or how to pan gold from the lakes, or how to make friends with the Krobus in the tunnels beneath the cemetery. </p>



<p>You’d spent your life tilling fields, fending off the encroaching weeds and fallen logs, looking for ways to grow your tomatoes fatter, your grape vines vinier. You’d raised buildings. Incubated eggs in beds of hay. You’d taken your sword and pickaxe into the caves, found the end of every secret passageway. All you knew was a life of ambition and forward movement.</p>



<p>On the day your daughter stops growing up, she spends an hour staring at a beam of light traveling across the floor. You watch her from the kitchen and try to make a mental list of every word she knows. The average two-year-old can speak about seventy words. Does your daughter know more than that? Less? Are there words you don’t know to count? Maybe ones she’s spoken only to herself, alone at night in her bed.</p>



<p>You decide not to worry yet. Maybe this is just a phase she is going through. Maybe all children stop growing up at some point, and then start up again. Like a plant hibernating in the cold.</p>



<p>Summer moves forward. Your daughter dashes through the house like a bird caught in a gale. Every morning you count her freckles, measure the length of her hair. One night, after her bath, you trim one of your daughter’s thumb nails with a pair of scissors. You want to prove that your daughter is still capable of change, or capable of being changed. You trim the nail so short that you accidentally nick the skin. As your daughter wails, you dab at the blood with a tissue. You kiss the top of her head and apologize until she’s lulled to sleep and you can tiptoe to your own bed. The next morning, the first thing you do is go to your daughter to check the cut. But it has healed. Or, more accurately, it has completely disappeared. The trimmed nail is exactly the same length as it had been the morning before. You touch the spot on her skin where you’d made her bleed. She doesn’t flinch at all.</p>



<p>Autumn
comes. Your daughter falls asleep in her tiny, four-post bed, like a sea maiden
floating out to sea. Spiders flee indoors to build cobwebs in corners. Leaves
change colors from the inside out. Your house fills with pumpkins big and small,
and your daughter likes to stack the smallest into tall, teetering towers. All
day, she wanders around the house in nothing but a diaper, completely
unashamed. Unaware of the difference between being naked and being clothed.</p>



<p>Later,
raking leaves around the chicken coop, you think of a time when you were
fifteen and drunk for the first time at a party. Your ride had left without you,
and you had to call your mother to pick you up. Sitting in the front seat of
her car, you felt exposed and embarrassed in your tank top, your mother’s eyes
on the lacy bra visible through the fabric. You’d bought the bra with your own
money at the mall last Saturday, had been hiding it under your bed, afraid of
what your mother would think if she found it while putting away the wash. </p>



<p>Halfway
home, you puked into the backseat. <em>Ugh,
I’m sorry, mom</em>, you said. <em>I’ll clean
it up. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. </em>The worst part was your mother’s silence. She
didn’t speak until you were home and she was tucking you into bed. She hadn’t
tucked you in for years. Your vision spun, and all you could do was look up at
her as she placed your arms under the covers and propped your head up with
pillows. As she turned off the lights, she paused in the doorway and sighed. “I
wish I still had my baby,” she said, and closed the door behind her.</p>



<p>You
understood in that moment that you were no longer the daughter your mother
wanted, had in fact replaced her. Your mother had wanted a child, but she
didn’t want this adult you were becoming. Every day you grew farther away from
the fantasy she’d had of you. This thought made you sad for yourself but also
sad for your mother.</p>



<p>When you learned you were pregnant, you swore to never mourn the versions of herself your daughter left behind. You wouldn’t mourn the sound of her laughing alone in her crib in the early morning. You wouldn’t mourn her letters to Santa Claus, signed in awkward cursive. When your daughter got her first tattoo, you wouldn’t mourn the skin she covered up. You wouldn’t just love these new versions of your daughter, you’d welcome and like them.</p>



<p>But
now you find yourself mourning all of these future versions of your daughter
you will never meet. Your mother had wished for a forever-baby, and now her
wish is your curse. </p>



<p>Fall
becomes winter. Every day for the past six months, your child has woken up as
the same child. On the morning of the first snow, you bring handfuls of white
snow into the house and your daughter eats it. Stuffs her mouth full, then
cries when it melts and dribbles down her chin.</p>



<p>You read in a child development book that children don’t start growing kneecaps until age three. That toddlers are ambidextrous. That two-year olds don’t understand yet that their mind is separate from other people’s. </p>



<p>You
understand now that this is how it will always be. This isn’t a phase. You will
grow old, and your baby will continue to be your baby. Continue to stack pumpkins
like blocks, continue to take handfuls of snow in her fists and expect it to
stay snow forever. Just as you can count on the Krobus to always be in the
sewers, and the dwarf to always be in the caves, and the wizard to always be in
his tower. You hope those other mothers were right. You hope the baby stage
will be the best.</p>



<p>You
wipe away the melted snow dripping down your daughter’s neck with the end of
your sleeve. Then you take her hand. You notice that her fist fits perfectly
inside your own, like a nut inside a shell. </p>



<p>“Want
to see more snow?” you ask your daughter.</p>



<p>“Snow,”
she says.

Neither of you are
wearing shoes or jackets, but you lead her outside onto the front porch anyway.
The warmth of the house still sticks to your skin and your clothes, and it will
be a minute before you feel the cold. Your daughter reaches out, waiting for
the snow to find her open palm, and you do the same.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>1. </p>



<p>Miss Pacman, bulimic, throws up cherries and
pretzels off-screen. Pacman, afraid of what he knows, eats. Both of them think
they are full but continue to wander the corners of their lonely dark yard,
looking for any overlooked power pellets. </p>



<p>2. </p>



<p>In one version of this story, Pacman is a
salaryman. Pacman eats and works in capsule hotels. We can assume this because
he is rarely seen on screen with Miss Pacman and his levels are small, tight
like a commute. Pacman makes a competitive salary yet his ghosts are never
satisfied. Pacman is always running, always eating, always tired. Pacman drinks
every night with his coworkers, binging on cherries and wondering if he will
ever achieve happiness.</p>



<p>3. </p>



<p>Pacman thought Blinky was his friend until
Blinky bit into his shoulder, and nothing was the same after that. </p>



<p>4.</p>



<p>The first time Pacman met Miss Pacman she was
eating a cake. She was a few booths down at the local Denny’s. Pacman could
relate; he ate all sorts of things: fruit, deserts, ghosts, people’s time.&nbsp; Everyone knows what it feels like to eat and
be filled, to need to be filled. Maybe they could get along, Pacman thought. </p>



<p>Miss Pacman ate beautifully. What did she enjoy,
Pacman wondered—what does any woman enjoy?&nbsp;
</p>



<p>He studied the cake, the way it folded under her
fork like linens. </p>



<p>Was she also eating and eating, trying to be
filled? Or with that cherry-red bow and perfect lipstick, had she found an
answer Pacman had missed? </p>



<p>Maybe I should join her, Pacman thought, but
remained in his booth and continued to watch. </p>



<p>5.</p>



<p>Miss Pacman’s dementia is getting worse. She
asks her husband: who are you? She finds herself running into walls, forgetting
where she is going. She is off-screen because she is tired. Her husband eats to
forget. He fills himself with fruit to keep himself busy. Idle men get eaten by
ghosts. He runs until he gets tired and then his memories eat him. </p>



<p>Whenever Pacman tries to run off-screen he
loops. Pacman is running in circles.</p>



<p>6. </p>



<p>Miss Pacman wasn’t Pacman’s first lover. There
was Pinky, Blinky, Inky and then Clyde. Even though those relationships ended
years ago, they linger behind Pacman wherever he goes. He doesn’t want Miss
Pacman to know this, yet she sees them too. She sees them in how quick Pacman’s
pace is, how he answers her questions briskly, how he always is looking over
his shoulder, as if&nbsp; being followed.</p>



<p>7. </p>



<p>Pacman wonders what happened between him and
Clyde. Years ago, they were friends when they suddenly drifted apart. They
tried to talk, but it felt forced, like a ritual. Pacman thinks about what he’d
say to Clyde, if they were sitting down in a café, catching up. Clyde’s never
been a man of many words, but neither has Pacman. He likes to think that
whatever they once had can be fixed. When it’s late at night and the world
feels overwhelming and too large to be consumed, Pacman thinks about this. </p>



<p>8.</p>



<p>Pacman has dreams where he and Clyde still talk,
where Blinky apologizes for biting him, where there’s closure with Pinky, and
Inky forgives him for being a juvenile jerk back in the day. Pacman has so many
dreams about his past that he begins to feel the separation between his past
and present selves. He walks in parks, picking up all the trash on the ground,
as if in a trance. Miss Pacman will find him in the middle of a park without
his shoes, sitting on a park bench. Miss Pacman has tried to express her worry,
telling Pacman he should consider seeing a therapist. Pacman tries to tell her
that everything is fine, but after driving him home from the park that day,
Miss Pacman won’t take no for an answer. </p>



<p>9.</p>



<p>After several years of goal-setting with his
therapist, Pacman has finally decided to eat his own ghosts. He has prepared
for this day. For years he has gone through exposure behavioral therapy, has
chased hypothetical ghosts for practice. He faces them today, and they become
small. He eats them, and they disappear briefly, but return the next day. After
several days of this, Pacman gets tired. What will it take to make his ghosts
disappear? <em>It’s funny, </em>he tells his
therapist, <em>how one minute, I feel in
control, and the next, I’m overpowered by the same fears as before. It’s like
my life is a never-ending cul-de-sac. </em></p>



<p>10. </p>



<p>In Pacman’s childhood, his father asked him
every day what he was going to do, and provided unsolicited answers.</p>



<p>Pacman’s father never stood still, but was
always in-transit. </p>



<p>Pacman’s father was never on-screen, but was a
necessary part of the story. </p>



<p>Pacman still thinks about his father whenever he
goes from cherry to orange to cake. He wonders what his father would think of
his dietary choices, if his father would approve of his career choice as a
professional food-gatherer. <em>We’re not in
the stone-age,</em> his father would say. <em>And
even if we were, women are the gatherers, men are the hunters. </em></p>



<p>Pacman’s never been much of a hunter. He prefers
long walks at the beach and conversations with good friends. </p>



<p>It has taken Pacman years to acknowledge that he
doesn’t need his father’s approval.</p>



<p>Even so, his father’s words trail behind him
continuously, and make him second-guess where he’s going. </p>



<p>11.</p>



<p>For as long as he can remember, Pacman’s been
bullied. He never turns around to see their faces but hears their voices
ricochet in his head. As an adult, Pacman knows that they have no power over
him, but he still finds himself on instinct running. </p>



<p>12.</p>



<p>Pacman is remembered as the top man of his
class. Everyone remembers Pacman. Voted “most likely to suceed” as well as
“most likely to eat all cakes in sight.” Pacman always had his shit together.
Pacman got the hot girl. Pacman became an arcade classic. Pacman is the
American dream.</p>



<p>At his high school reunion, Pacman opens up
after a few drinks. Miss Pacman remembers how he was in the car ride here:
nervously tucking his stomach into his pants, over and over, checking his hair
in the mirror. </p>



<p>But now, he laughs again. The world is in Blue
Mode, and Pacman is eating it all up. He recreates the Pacman everyone
remembers. </p>



<p>But Miss Pacman knows this is only brief:<br>that this is just a game, a show,<br>that the ghosts will return,<br>that we are all cycling the same floor of our lives, <br>looping in new rooms to deceive ourselves <br>into thinking we have changed something <br>by our own strength.<br></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning, in God Mode, there was nothing but a stretch of open ocean, blue featureless water on the face of the massive three-quarter perspective grid on Tim’s computer screen. This is how he chose to begin, in water. He could have started with plains, plains and mountains, but he didn’t. He wanted to raise an island. An island was better, he thought. An island is alone, and that is how Tim thinks of her. Jan. He opened up the disaster controls and selected the Volcano button.</p>
<p>This was going to be her head, Tim decided. This is where he would begin. Soon there would be a whole body, a whole island shaped like her, like Jan. Janopolis, he would name the city. After her, after Jan. Jan from work. Jan who looked up and smiled.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jan is handing out jars of raspberry preserves to her friends in the office. Jan does this every year: she hands out raspberry preserves. Last year she started to add little embroidered fabric covers tied on to the lids of the jars with ribbons. Jan is handing out jars of raspberry preserves around the office, someone pops their head around the corner of Tim’s cubicle to say. Everyone loves Jan’s raspberry preserves. Jan makes delightful raspberry preserves that everyone loves, is what everyone says about Jan to people who don’t know Jan. Tim thinks it is annoying. Jan is about so much more than raspberry preserves.</p>
<p>“Hey, Tim!” says Jan as she puts a jar with a blue fabric cover on Tim’s desk. “Raspberry preserves for you!” She says that it’s just a little something. Tim reaches out for the jar but Jan doesn’t stay long enough for him to say thanks.</p>
<p>“Hey, Frank! Raspberry preserves for you!” Tim hears Jan say in the cubicle next to his.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Give your city a name:</em></p>
<p>Janopolis</p>
<p><em>Mayor name:</em></p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<p><em>Mayor name:</em></p>
<p>Maybe it should be Jan, Tim thought. It is her city, Jan’s city, after all. But Jan was not really around to make policy decisions, Tim realized.</p>
<p><em>Mayor name:</em></p>
<p>Tim.</p>
<p>When Tim entered his name, the city of Janopolis was incorporated.</p>
<p>Tim built a central downtown area for mixed commercial and residential use around the bay formed by the Janopolis Island thighs: Downthere, where he planted a triangular forest of dark spruce trees. With the water and the trees, the medium wealth residential zoning he placed there grew into rows of wonderful brownstones. Janstones, laughed Tim, and he spent four hours that night marking each of these buildings as historical landmarks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim hears Jan tell Mary, who sits across from Jan, about how her boyfriend is such a big help around the house. “It’s an old building so there’s a lot that needs to be fixed. And he’s just great with the tools.” Mary makes a noise like <em>mmmm</em>&#8211;<em>hmmm</em> and then Jan and Mary laugh. Tim thinks that Jan must be happy living in an old building. Tim thinks Jan may also collect antiques.</p>
<hr />
<p>If  Jan lived in Janopolis, Tim decided, Jan would live in Downthere, in an old brownstone on the banks of the Creek, in a house he right-clicked and named Jan’s-on-the-Water. He named her street Jan’s Street, which ran between Jan Boulevard and Jan Road. She worked in an office building in East Neck. She took the bus. Tim bulldozed a brownstone to make sure there was a bus stop right next to Jan’s house.</p>
<p>Tim imagined that he lived in Janopolis, too, but he was the Mayor so he lived in the Mayor’s House, which was a special reward building he was allowed to place after the city had reached its first five hundred residents. Tim the Mayor’s House, he called it, and put it on a hill right next to the Janopolis Cemetery, which also was a special reward, given after the first five hundred residents died.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jan does not like it when her boyfriend calls her too much at work. She usually rolls her eyes before she picks up the phone; Tim can see her from where he sits. Jan shakes her head to what her boyfriend says on the phone to her. She sticks a finger in her free ear, as if she can’t hear her boyfriend in the noise of the office. But she isn’t trying to hear her boyfriend better, she is trying to shove her finger straight through her head to plug up her other ear. This way she won’t have to hear what her boyfriend is saying at all. Sometimes, Jan’s boyfriend calls back five minutes after she has hung up on him. To say sorry. Jan rubs her hands up and down her freckled arms. This makes Jan feel better, Tim thinks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim built a subway system. Tim built a water park and a marina. Tim built fire houses and kept them fully staffed and running. Tim provided public libraries. Tim opened the University of Janopolis and made sure it was surrounded by fun arcades and parks. Tim built a helipad for the hospital. At five o’clock in the morning, Tim told himself that it was time to go to bed and get some sleep. Tim still had two solid hours before he had to wake up for work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Are you listening, Tim? asks Todd, Tim’s supervisor, at the meeting that morning. Tim was not listening.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim spent all of the money Janopolis had at the start of the game. Janopolis had a budget deficit in the thousands. Janopolis’ yearly income was written in red numbers instead of green.</p>
<p>To compensate, Tim increased residential tax rates. But that drove out the middle class. The older sections of Janopolis became slums. The graphics of the buildings changed: their paint dulled, their roofs sagged and their windows and doors boarded up. The older residents had died off and younger residents were choosing newer, more fashionable neighborhoods to live in. The police chief character appeared in a pop-up screen.</p>
<p>Tim bulldozed a block of the original homes of Janopolis, not far from Jan’s-on-the-Water, and placed a park there instead. Tim hoped things would get better.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jan is in a rush in the hallway, and she smashes into Tim.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” says Tim. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Jan laughs. “Oh my God, I’m such a klutz! My boyfriend is always telling me I’m such a klutz.”</p>
<p>Tim picks up his legal pad which has fallen next to Jan’s leg.</p>
<p>His eyes focus intensely on his legal pad.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” says Tim. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim took pictures of Janopolis, and typed quick descriptions for them. <em>Jan and the Mayor take in some avant-garde poetry at the Belly Button Café</em>, wrote Tim. Flames shooting out of a two-family detached: <em>Janopolis’ Bravest fighting a blaze in Frecklington</em>. Tim took pictures and wouldn’t remember why they were significant, typing only the neighborhood name—Jan’s Ring, Chestin—and it may be the pictures were taken just for that reason: to capture that place, that moment, before Tim shut down the game and started it up again the next night to find that place different than it was before.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jan is falling behind at work. Jan is late again. Todd and Laura, the supervisors, are talking about it in Todd’s office. Tim gets a drink from the water cooler, which is next to Todd’s door. Laura says this can’t keep happening. Laura asks Todd what he thinks they should do about it. I don’t know, Todd says, I don’t know what we should do about it. Laura says Jan better get her fucking act together real quick. Sure, fine, I’ll tell her, says Todd.</p>
<p>Laura comes out of the office and sees Tim standing by the cooler.</p>
<p>“Oh hey, Tim. That reminds me—about you moving to the other side of the office. It’s still a no-go, but there might be something opening up soon, I’ll let you know when I know.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” says Tim, but Tim does not really mean it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim watched the traffic patterns of Janopolis. Cars swerved fluidly around the statue of Jan in the rotary, yellow buses dropped off kids in front of schools, dump trucks brought trash to the Laura Waste Management Landfill. All this traffic moved smoothly. The people of Janopolis commuted. Tim saw their every move: from when they left their homes until they got to work. With a click of a button with a moon on it, Tim watched the Janopolisans returning to their homes.</p>
<p>Everyone can get to work on time in Janopolis, thought Tim. No one has any excuses. Not here.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jan comes into the office wearing wrap-around sunglasses. She doesn’t even take them off at her desk. One of the women who sits close to Jan asks her what the sunglasses are about. She kind of asks if anything is wrong. Jan says it’s fine, she says that she “has a migraine” and it’s “making her really sensitive to light.” “It’s no big deal,” Jan says but the next day she takes a personal day, and on the day after that, too, Friday.</p>
<hr />
<p>Using the Road Tools menu, Tim paved over the Eye Lakes with a patch of black asphalt. Tim turned the two bodies of water into a matching pair of dark, vacant parking lots.</p>
<hr />
<p>Everyone talks about Jan because she is not at the office. They take obvious, long looks around Jan’s cubicle and at the things on Jan’s desk. They pick up the picture of Jan and her boyfriend, Paul, taken while they were hiking. Mary wonders when she’s just going to break up with him already. Mary thinks Jan deserves to have someone nice.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim used the level tool to drag out a spit of land from the beach in the Shins neighborhood out into open water, like an umbilical cord, or a tether. Out there, he used the raise terrain tool to pull up the seafloor, which he teased, and shaped, until it was in the shape of a man. It was smaller than Janopolis Island. He could only fit a lighthouse, a water tower, and a single electric windmill on it. He used the lower terrain tool to sink the spit of land between Janopolis to the island. And when he opened up the label tool he made a signpost which he planted at the center of the island and named it. <em>Tim</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>When Jan comes back in on Monday she is wearing an engagement ring on her finger. The female co-workers all crowd into her cubicle to get a look at it. That’s a nice one, they say to Jan, who nods her head, yes, she thinks so too.</p>
<hr />
<p>In God Mode, Tim considered the disaster controls. The disasters explained themselves when he hovered his cursor over them. Tornado: <em>Control a violent swirling wind that leaves a path of destruction through your city</em>. Robot attack: <em>An enormous robot that can shoot laser beams from its eyes and razor missiles from its fists attacks your city</em>. There are other options. Tim can manually set fire to the power plants, plunging the city in darkness. The meteor strike will leave a deep crater in the middle of the city. Likewise, the bright orange Obliterate City button was not technically a disaster. It was located on a completely different menu.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jan no longer gives out jars of raspberry preserves every year. It could be that Jan no longer makes them. Tim doesn’t ask her about it. Nobody does.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You and your wife, turned to stone. Together you stand in the room where the monster cast the spell, looking at the empty throne, the ornate carpet, the pots of fire burning hot. All gray through your pebbled eyes. You don’t look anywhere else. It’s impossible to turn your head.</p>
<p>With the monsters gone, treasure hunters scale the towers with ease and find you. They don’t remember meeting you before you were a statue. They marvel at how lifelike you are. They reckon they’ll sell you both for a pretty penny. Heavy as you are, they drag you out of the tower on your back, and the sky, too, is gray.</p>
<p>You imagine your uncle searching for you, sending his men. You imagine your children, the twins, crying in a way they’ve never cried before, an omen, a signal that something horrible has happened. You imagine these things so clearly it is almost like you’re watching them through a tiny screen held in your hands.</p>
<p>You, so lifelike, are auctioned off to the highest bidder, a very rich man. The treasure hunters keep your wife, to let her accumulate in value, to sell at a later date. The rich man takes you to his home, sets you up in the lawn, staring out across the ocean like an adventurer, an explorer. The man has an infant son of his own.</p>
<p>You once wondered what it meant to be turned to stone. If you would simply be encased in a thick layer of rock, the same flesh and muscle and bone beneath it. But no, you are changed through and through. Your guts are boulders, your blood hardened. Your whole body layered like the crust of the earth.</p>
<p>Even unable to lie down or close your eyes, you sleep, or something like it. There, even your dreams become sedentary, static. You spend days on the couch, scrolling through feeds, waiting for streams to buffer. You do nothing. Grand plans crack and fall apart, dusting the dusty tile floor of your two-bedroom house, so full of echoes now. Your roommate is never home.</p>
<p>You watch years pass. It must be torture, unable to move, waiting for time to carve its way, but there are gaps, like a black screen between scenes, where everything speeds up. The man’s son learns to crawl, then stand. You miss his first steps, facing the wrong direction, but you can hear the fussing of his parents behind you as he stumbles toward them.</p>
<p>When their son is out of earshot indoors, you hear the man and his wife fret over terrifying rumors, things going wrong in the world. They call you their good luck statue. They have been very lucky since you arrived. They believe you’ll protect them, like a saint on a stained glass window, filtering the world into always something beautiful.</p>
<p>You think of your own children, measure their growth, their lives, by the rich couple’s son, who is older now, articulate and adventurous, who spends hours running in circles around you, pretending to fight, drawing a sword and challenging you to a duel.</p>
<p>In your sedentary dreams, you are unmarried, childless. You sit on your bed, a pillow behind your back. You stream television shows on your laptop, scroll through feeds on your phone. The mail arrives. More wedding invitations. You magnet them to your fridge, all these teeth-glistening photos of friends pairing off.</p>
<p>You wake one day to the sky gone black. Monsters descend upon the child. Here is where you should fight, throw your edged boomerang, strike with your blade, but you are a statue, a lawn ornament. You cannot move. You are not even good luck. The monsters take the child away, just as they took you as a boy. There is nothing you can do to stop it.</p>
<p>The rich man, for months, paces the front lawn. The search parties come back with no news, no sign of the boy. The man, he kicks you, knocks you over. You don’t feel it, because your skin is stone, but it is painful all the same. Now all you see are gray tufts of grass.</p>
<p>Leaves cover you, then snow. Flowers spring up, then wither. It all keeps happening again and again. And you feel guilty, but after all you’ve been through, stillness like this, it is almost pleasant. It is almost a relief. You are not the hero, and you never will be. Leave it to someone else. <em>And so the days and years passed. </em>You hear those words as though reading the text in the air.</p>
<p>In your sedentary dreams, you might as well be stone. You go to work, you come home, you scroll through feeds while streams buffer, but it’s all the same. You’re not going anywhere. You don’t know where else you’d go.</p>
<p>Still, you picture your wife out there, adorning someone else’s lawn. You think of your children and wonder what their lives are like. It is hard to measure their ages without the rich man’s child growing up before your very eyes, but you imagine the twins must be about as old as the boy and girl who are coming up the front walkway now, coming to sit beside you where you lay. Yes, these children, they look to be the exact right age.</p>
<p>The children, they exchange looks. The girl wields a marbled staff. She raises it toward the sky, and a strange light engulfs you. The machinations of your body start up like an earthquake. You blink shale from eyes. Your skin, it’s so soft.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara &amp; I meet at the mayor’s tiny house to salvage the gleaming green rupees scattered across his lawn among the stones &amp; shrubbery. Today, like every day since birth, we wear matching green tunics &amp; chug milk out of mason jars to strengthen our shield-arms. Our rusted swords dice the No Trespassing signpost &amp;, with a running start, I somersault into the hedges, stuffing emerald gems into my wallet, while Sara smashes the artisanal clay vases on his porch. When I roll spine-first into an oak tree, her giggles crescendo into a shriek until she sounds like a domestic hen pierced by a flaming arrow. The purple maw of a flower resembling a giant Venus flytrap clamps down on Sara’s boot, so I charge in circles waving my blade at the wind, oak shield brandished from a ten-foot distance. She severs the mutant plant’s stalk &amp;, to celebrate our success, I detonate a homemade bomb that pulverizes a boulder then declare myself Guardian of the Wood. Sara slingshots an acorn that pegs my forehead &amp; points to her assailant’s stem slashed at the root. She waits for me to piece a vase back together, fill it with water, &amp; carry it home.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>skulls are rolling in each level a new pyramid coloured from purple to orange to green to red to black to pink bricks of pixels chains of fire if you looked at the pyramids from above and they opened one by one they would uncover entire labyrinths of dead ends traps and trapdoors skulls are rolling let the spiders swarm out let the snakes billow out</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(after Mary Shelley)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quitted Geneva, and my wanderings began. The blue Mediterranean <em>(worse than Spanish flu).</em> The wilds of Tartary and Russia <em>(worse than smallpox).</em> The vast wilds of South America <em>(normal life beginning to break down).</em> I <em>(could become unstoppable)</em> followed the rivers. It was there the population <em>(being infected faster and faster) </em>chiefly collected. They were dead, and I lived. Care was new, and agony unknown!</p>
<p>But this quickly</p>
<p><em>(cure is 25 percent complete)</em></p>
<p>gave way</p>
<p><em>(cure is 50 percent complete)</em></p>
<p>to despair.</p>
<p>I was about to <em>(shuts land borders) </em>sink<em> (bans all flights) </em>under <em>(leading global cure effort) </em>the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel, hopes of succor and life. You took me on board when my vigor was exhausted <em>(releasing pathogen into the air). </em>You <em>(infectious disease teams)</em> took your passage in the same ship. I escaped, you knew not now. Your <em>(cure research) </em>plan was <em>(expected to take a long time) </em>unsettled.</p>
<p>During sleep alone <em>(mutated and developed the Insomnia symptom) </em>could you taste joy! Many hard and miserable hours must you—</p>
<p>Sorry. Little flowery there. I need to talk myself up when I’m afraid. Bravado’s free. So is travel, if you’re me. I love to travel! Never unpack! But this ticket was one way.</p>
<p>One way in, and no way out. I got here <em>(closes all ports) </em>just in time. My ship came in.</p>
<p>If things don’t turn around for me here, I don’t know what I’ll—</p>
<p><em>(leading global cure effort)</em></p>
<p>Sustained and inspirited by the hope of night.</p>
<p>Greenland. Flatland. One-dimensional. A great white expanse, all life fading, falling away. Barely anyone in the towns (<em>dying faster than new people are being infected), </em>no lamb or kid <em>(bans movement of livestock), </em>not a single flying thing <em>(exterminates all birds) </em>in the sky. No birdsong! Nothing. Not a creature <em>(declares martial law) </em>sets foot outside. I haven’t talked to anyone, anywhere <em>(shuts down mobile networks) </em>in such a long time.</p>
<p>Aren’t you lonely, everyone asks? No. No one. No one asks. All the mornings are silent. I am a monster, cut off from all the world.</p>
<p>Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing!</p>
<p>Better I quit the neighborhood of man. I’m <em>(significantly harder to cure)</em> better off without company. I seem to be <em>(becoming scary) </em>the introverted type. I know I can be <em>(hard to control) </em>a little moody sometimes, a little <em>(randomly mutates rapidly) </em>mercurial—but I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth! Who can I seize, and educate as my <em>(infected more people than HIV)</em> companion and friend?</p>
<p>Shall I respect man, when he <em>(approves human experimentation)</em> contemns me?</p>
<p><em>(research teams to infected countries)</em></p>
<p>You, out there. You. Pitiless as <em>(prioritizes healthcare)</em> you have been. You, who were there for my first breath, who <em>(has infected its first human)</em> first breathed me in. I’m sorry. I couldn’t accept, couldn’t believe that <em>(medicine slowing infection) </em>things were over between us, before they’d even started. I may have <em>(irrational delusions and mental symptoms) </em>overreacted, when you <em>(distributes face masks) </em>shut me out. I’m <em>(unlikely to seek treatment or cooperate with others) </em>not someone who takes rejection well. You knew that when you met me. You knew I was <em>(hurting and killing people) </em>alone, and <em>(the beginning of something terrible)</em> miserable. From you, only you, could I hope for succor, and you—</p>
<p><em>(will find it hard to rebuild civilization)</em></p>
<p>Tell me why I should pity you more than you pity me.</p>
<p>If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear! I will work at your destruction, so that you curse the hour of—</p>
<p>The snows descend on my head. I see the print of my huge step on the white plain. I seek the everlasting ices of the north. My reign is <em>(the ultimate infectious disease) </em>not yet over!</p>
<p><em>(cure is 75 percent complete)</em></p>
<p>Do you dare destroy my hopes?</p>
<p><em>(cure is 95 percent complete)</em></p>
<p>I am alone. Miserably alone.</p>
<p><em>(it should never have gone ahead)</em></p>
<p>The print of my step, on the white plain. Trenchlike, cavernous <em>(uses mass graves)</em>, swallowing hundreds, thousands, millions falling to my depths—that wonderful moment, when they’d turn back, gazing at me, that boiling light in their eyes as they realized there was nothing beneath their feet, and they all fell and fell and fell! But now, I see the bottom of the chasm. It rises up to meet me, a little higher every day, relentless floodwaters where I’ll fall, I’ll drown. The print of my step was cut sharp and deep over all the earth but now it fills in, softens, fades beneath the snows. The horrible cleansing snows. And there is nothing, not even in the hope of night, nothing I can do but watch.</p>
<p>I swear to you, I will quit the neighborhood of man! My evil passions will have fled!</p>
<p>I should’ve taken that left turn at Albuquerque.</p>
<p><em>(the cure is finished and is being deployed worldwide)</em></p>
<p>I don’t feel so good. Maybe I should go back inside, and lie—</p>
<p>—down. Right here in the snow, here where my step was once cut, sharp and deep, over all the earth. The night fades. <em>(weak and used to hot temperatures) </em>Immobile, I gaze up at the sky, at its boiling lights beneath blank and fading clouds. These bleak skies. Kinder to me than your fellow beings.</p>
<p>The print of my fingers on the white plain.</p>
<p>In my dying moments, I will not curse my maker.</p>
<p><em>(large numbers of people have died and the world is changed forever)</em></p>
<p>I can’t—</p>
<p><em>(your plague lost the game!)</em></p>
<p><em>(try again to unlock the next plague type)</em></p>
<p>Oh!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Theseus needs no weapons. It needs no drones. It is equipped to absorb and evade a certain percentage of incoming attacks, but rarely must it withstand more than two volleys, because our crew includes no fewer than four Mantis soldiers, whose <em>modus operandi </em>is to teleport onto an enemy ship and massacre its crew. When a Mantis falls in battle, a clone appears in the cloning bay moments later. When an enemy crew attempts to resist destruction by retreating to their healing bay, we fire a lockdown missile to seal the poor devils in the engine room, for instance, where our Mantis killers cut them down. As a last resort or diversion, we deploy the mind control system and turn one human rebel against his fellows.</p>
<p>In this era of rebellion, the Federation has placed its hope of preservation in the Theseus. We, its captains, administer bloodbaths in the course of our mission. Purportedly, officially, we are fully justified in employing our methods, however brutal they may seem to our colleagues, however much those colleagues may whisper behind our backs, however uneasy it makes them that we command a Mantis ship and hire as many Mantis soldiers as will fit in the hold. The few other members of our crew would rather not work with Mantises, just as the other races of the Federation at large would rather not count the Mantis among their allies; but our crew will not mutiny, and the Federation will not part ways with the Mantis. Without the Mantis, the human rebels would surely conquer the Federation.</p>
<p>Other captains destroy rebel ships—in accordance with their code of honor, they suppose. We are content to slaughter rebel crews. Leave the ship intact, we say, only wash the deck in human blood. Other captains panic when the enemy boards their ship; we relish the opportunity to send our Mantises into the breach. Long have we felt an affinity for these overgrown insects, this teeming intergalactic pestilence. We could not, any longer, bear to command some other crew, some group of men or women who valued their lives. The Mantis take no prisoners and refuse to be taken. An individual Mantis may die, but another of the same name will presently take its place. The Mantis do not rest until the enemy ship is drifting uselessly, lifelessly in space. Likewise, we do not rest until the enemy ship, unscathed, falls silent. What a pathetic delusion is a code of honor when seen through the Mantis eye.</p>
<p>One single worry, and one only, keeps us up at night. What if, in the crucial moment, in the last battle, we encounter a self-captained ship? What if, after we had killed an entire crew of eight men and women, in short order and with no little relish, the ship’s computer were then to assume control? Our Mantises are capable of demolishing a ship, slowly but surely, by smashing its systems one by one. And our Mantises have no fear of perishing in the wreck, for their selfsame namesakes will appear aboard the Theseus in short order. But what if the enemy ship’s computer were to erect a shield that blocked teleportation? What if the enemy ship’s computer were to fire drones at the Theseus, set its rooms ablaze, take control of Nazia’s mind, or Monsvik’s, or Ferry’s? A Mantis mind is not difficult to dominate; it possesses no resources with which to resist subjugation.</p>
<p>What gives us no peace, what haunts us even in that sublime moment following a battle, in that quiet moment of mandibular clicking and mechanical buzzing, is the dim recognition that our dream means something different from what we have dreamed it meant. The overflowing, inextinguishable life, the metastatic vitality of the Mantis, is not, as we had thought, or as we had wanted to believe, the true apotheosis of our vision. If someday the final battle takes the form that our nightmares take, of an automated terror, then it will have been the enemy, not we, who followed the argument to its furthest conclusion. The enemy, not we, will have realized that the best way to extinguish enemy life is not to inundate it with irrepressible Mantis life, but rather to calculate, with mineral efficiency and mathematical precision, the complete, irrevocable dissolution of living matter. These Mantis butchers, our proxies in the battle against recalcitrant humanity, would then dissolve into space like so many atoms, like so many monads without purpose.</p>
