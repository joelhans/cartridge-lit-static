            In the game, he is more superhuman than he is in real life: muscles swollen out from underneath low-rising socksâ&#128;&#148;a man who can expose skin because he is not worried about exposure to the brambles left behind by the windâ&#128;&#148;someone who can bleed and not think anything of it because there has been nothing left to rust. There is no blood.          </a>

            I had spent far too much time there, longer than the rest of the game combined. I cannot speak of it much. Like its tunnels, Moria is too serpentine, too dense, too dark. I have nothing good to say about that place.          </a>

            Steel, granite, and glass reached for the heavens along a long curved peninsula, true downtown lying on a raised plateau overlooking a tropical bay, causing the blue and green and brown buildings to extend higher. Suburban sprawl, fields of factories, spiraled out from the dense center, bedroom communities and farming towns.          </a>

            Unlike the unfamiliar neighborhoods I had to traverse in my Driverâ&#128;&#153;s Ed car, the Noopy landmarks were straightforward and easy to map: Tom Nookâ&#128;&#153;s place. Able Sisters. The town hall. The dump. The museum. Neighborsâ&#128;&#153; houses, the river, the bridges, the cliff, the sea.          </a>

            Sometimes you have to earn the horse, like a weapon or a boat or an airship. You acquire it by completing a fetch quest for a cranky farmer, or jacking a horse out from under some random villager. You are not punished for this because you are saving the world.          </a>

            The wind that blew here was surprisingly cold, and Danielâ&#128;&#153;s lips blued, unseen. A deer picked its way past his body, stepping lightly in the curve of his elbow and springing away when a bird flew off a nearby tree branch.          </a>
